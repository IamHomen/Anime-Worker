Ayase, who was born with an \"Omega mutation\" in this world where only betas exist, has to labor as an AV male actor in order to secretly obtain expensive suppressants. \"I would never be able to have a normal love life\" is what Ayase thought, but one day, a fateful encounter with a man named Inukai left him with an uncontrollable desire. However, when they tried connecting their bodies for the first time that night, 'that' happened?!",
