  "description": "Description :\r\n        For an orphan, Lee Goyo is a lucky child. She was rescued along with a prosecutor\u2019s son in a kidnapping 14 years ago and became the adopted daughter of ex-prosecutor Lee Uitaek. However, she didn\u2019t have a sweet life, but a life of hellfire. In exchange for being with Lee Uitaek and his son, she became their doll and dog. \n\n\u201cLee Uitaek told me to seduce you.\u201d\n\n \u201cIf I tease you, will you come?\u201d\n\n \u201cWhat do you think we\u2019ll do all night long?\u201d\n\n \u201c\u2026I guess I was thinking too grandly. In the end, it was just going to be a meaningless night.\u201d\n\n In order to survive, she had to continue proving her worth even if it meant seducing KJ Finance\u2019s president, Kwon Jaeheon, a man she had no relationship with. \n\n \u201cWhat I want is\u2026 A life of freedom. \n\nNo matter how hard she struggled, she couldn\u2019t escape that hell on her own.\n\n \u201cPromise me one thing. Promise that you\u2019ll save me from them.\u201d\n\n I would even eat a poisoned apple.\n\n \u201cI told you that I\u2019d give it to you even if it killed me. Don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d\n\n At that moment, that crazy and dangerous man seemed like a savior leading her to paradise in Goyo\u2019s eyes.",
