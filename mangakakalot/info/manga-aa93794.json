  "description": "Description :\r\n        Hina is very popluar with the guys, but all they see her as is a girl friend (A girl who is only a friend). She has no luck with guys because of this, so she gets it tough everytime she is told she is only thought of as \"one of the guys\". Satou claims she is very unpopular and Hina asks why. He doesn't say, but she tries to make him tell her. Usually, Hina has always been the bridge for others to cross (Which means in cases of love), but maybe this time, she might be the one who gets to cross the bridge for the first time?!",
