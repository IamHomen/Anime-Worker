Himiko, our hero decides to cast his lot in with her to bring about world peace by uniting it all under one banner.That said, the only way they can do this is through fighting their way past many of the legendary heroes of old. Only this time, they all seem to be cute girls instead!Journeying to the four corners of the Earth, they will have to deal with the likes of Oda Nobunaga, King Arthur, Napoleon, Lu Bu and many others on their path to world domination.As the comic version of the game series Eiyu*Senki, this manga brings more original story arcs for the lovable characters of the series in a world similar yet different to that of the games.",
