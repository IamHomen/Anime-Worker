  "description": "Description :\r\n        \"Is this person already dead...? \nBehind the door, lying in bed, is a grotesque figure...\nAkane Kuritani, a new caregiver, arrives at a secluded Western-style mansion deep in the mountains to provide live-in care for Hiwako Miyazono, the bedridden owner. Hoping for a fresh start, Akane is shocked to find Hiwako emanating a putrid smell, with discolored skin and a burlap sack over her face, looking nothing less than a 'corpse.' The nature of the care she must provide is clearly abnormal...\nBased on a Kadokawa Horror Bunko novel, a terrifying nursing care horror tale begins.",
