  "description": "Description :\r\n        The year is 2022. Mankind has finally perfected virtual reality. And within the VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) Sword Art Online, there was a player called Kirito. While he was enjoying the world of SAO, he and the other 10,000 logged-in players all received a frightening message from the Game Master\u2014that the only way to escape from that world was to clear the game, and that a game over within the game would mean their death in the real world. That was the frightening true story behind this game. Kirito was one of the first players to accept this \u201ctruth\u201d, and began his solo play, refusing to form a party, as he threw himself into the never ending battles that lay before him\u2026",
