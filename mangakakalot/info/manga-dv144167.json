  "description": "Description :\r\n        Seven years ago, Toraji met the most beautiful man he had ever seen.\nThe time they spent together was as passionate as it was brief, and the man disappeared among the multitudes of Edo, the shogunate's capital. Toraji never learned his real name, or address, or occupation - but he never gave up on finding him again.\nOnly, he didn't expect that when he did, the man would turn out to be the master of a high-class ryokan and restaurant, or that he would have a young daughter. How did this happen? Why did he run? Who is the child's mother and where is she?\nAnd most of all, will Toraji get a second chance to pursue the one great love of his life?",
