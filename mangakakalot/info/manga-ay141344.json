  "description": "Description :\r\n        In the world of \"Doseverse,\" there are people with special characteristics: \"Drugs\" who can cure the illness of others just by touching them, and \"Krankes\" who are born with chronic health problems. Mikasaki, a \"Kranke\" for whom no treatment works, meets Yuma, a \"Drug\" at the medical facility where he is admitted. Mikasaki feels uncomfortable around Asuma, a refreshing elite who is the complete opposite of himself, but when Asuma touches him for treatment, a sense of pleasure wells up inside him... \"It's okay, you can feel good.\" Even though he knows it's a medical procedure, he kisses him deeply and heals him until he melts - the one who saves and the one who can only be saved... the ultimate love born in an absurd world.+",
