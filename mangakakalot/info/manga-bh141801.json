  "description": "Description :\r\n        In the interview room, they spoke of a warm world and justice, but in the end, a newspaper company is still a company, and a company is just that. Starting the day at 5G speed but ending it at 3G, Weekend work is a given, and being on-call is an option. The more incidents and accidents, the more work piles up, So I wish for world peace now more than ever. Yet when I see the numbers in my bank account, all I feel is sadness. This is the story of a realistic journalist living in a world full of inevitable things. Even so, the \u201cclickbait journalist\u201d and \u201ccorporate worker,\u201d Who wander with hope, hoping to improve even just a little, Find themselves constantly torn between two worlds. The cat reporter, caught in the middle,\nHeads to work again today, stumbling along the way.",
