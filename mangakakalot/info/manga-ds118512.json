  "description": "Description :\r\n        In a flash, Akihabara, the legendary Otaku neighborhood, was teleported to Fairleaf, a country in a fantasy world of spirits and magic. After an investigation, Akihabara's culture and technology spreads throughout Fairleaf, sparking a cultural revolution.\n\nBrought along for the ride, Kubo Toshinori runs the Galge company \"Eternal Soft\" in this new world. Alongside his cute Beastfolk assistant (and PR manager) Monica and his half-elf Potion-binging Programmer Iris Ohkawa, Kubo and Eternal Soft continue the constant struggle against deadlines, Twitter trolls, and software bugs!",
