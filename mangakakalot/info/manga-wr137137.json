  "description": "Description :\r\n        This spinoff series from Xam'd: Lost Memories portrays Takato Isshin, owner of a strange compass, as he stumbles upon two Tessican sisters on a pilgrimage.Nangai Island is a small isolated rural island where nothing happens. This is where Isshin Takato has grown up and now lives alone.Meanwhile, Hina and Karahina are two Tessican sisters with a secret that would make even the Army wary. Although they are on a search for their holy land, the older sister's incredibly bad sense of direction has landed them on Nangai Island instead of their target continent.Due to a series of events, Isshin and the two sisters end up fleeing the Army and the island, with only his father's boat and compass to guide them. And thus begins another story in Xam'd, an incredible journey around the world.",
