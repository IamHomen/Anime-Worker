Why does this person remember me?\nIt was unexpectedly due to an exception of the curse.\nUm. Well, I'll help you until the female lead appears.\nThe only one who can break the curse is the female lead, so that it doesn't deviate from the original story.\n...Yeah, that's exactly what she thought.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nKiss.\nI felt a soft touch on my cheek along with an unfamiliar sound. A tiny kiss landed on my cheek.\n\"...Le-Leonard.\"\n\"Stay still. It's interfering with the treatment.\"\n\"No, but that's...\"\nI understand that you're healing the injured area with the energy of life.\n\"Is there any other way than this? You can just touch the injured area with your hand...\"\n\"No.\"\nLeonard just cut me off.\n...No, there's no such thing!",
