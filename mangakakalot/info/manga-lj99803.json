  "description": "Description :\r\n        From Nakama: Masculine, cheerful Sakamoto Hideomi, reigning top host at a popular host club, was tricked into taking responsibility for a huge debt. His only recourse is to go home, which he hasn't visited even once in seven years. The only person there is his \"brother\" of the same age, Yukiya -- although they aren't related by blood. As a day trader, Yukiya earns loads, but he has one condition for shouldering the debt: that they live together. However, the reason why Hideomi left the house was his attack on the awkward, beautiful Yukiya ... !? The dramatic, love-filled story of a popular ex-host and a beautiful day trader!",
