Being blessed with beauty and intelligence, she soon gains popularity as Harrison's poster girl. But it also means she is a target of political enemies. Therefore, Harrison hires one of the best bodyguards for her-- Ridge Jackson. Dara is stunned when she sees his shadowy gold eyes. How seductive he is... Isn't it more dangerous to be with this sexy guy than to be a target of political rivalry?",
