  "description": "Description :\r\n        University student Saku longs to have a fairytale romance, but even though he has no trouble getting with girls, they all break up with him for the same reason: he doesn't make their heart flutter at all!And then there's Misumi, the university's resident heartthrob who's wildly popular with the girls, and who's taken a sudden interest in Saku. He doesn't laugh at Saku's fantasies and listens to them sincerely, and if Saku is nearby, he'll go to him without fail. Misumi seems to always say or do the right things that make his own heart start to flutter a little, so Saku starts to look to him for tips and techniques on how to make his fairytale romance come true.But before he knows it, he's suddenly falling in love with Misumi instead...?!",
