  "description": "Description :\r\n        I possessed the novel with three people who were my counterparts. Among them, I became the prince's fiancee and a villain youngae who ended her life with the guillotine ending. \u201cI'm happy though. We are all female protagonists in novels, so we can spare our lives.\u201d \u2026 Were all female protagonists? I rolled my eyes awkwardly and finally opened my mouth. \"Ah\u2026 , I will soon be the guillotine.\u201d * * * It caused inconvenience to everyone. I thought the best thing I could do for everyone was to break up... \u2026 . \u201cWe are breaking up.\u201d \u201cBelly, what have I done to you? If you have a reason, tell me.\u201d You catch me asking for a breakup. \u201cBelly. I have no intention of giving up on you.\u201d \u201cIf you can escape, run away. Even if it were death, I would gladly follow you.\u201d Apparently, the keyword of the novel was affectionate man. When did the keyword change to obsessive? Will I be able to see the ending safely?",
