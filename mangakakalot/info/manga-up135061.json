  "description": "Description :\r\n        Kim Minseong dedicated 12 years of his life to baseball, from elementary to high school. However, after facing rejection from his first love, he felt that his life lost its purpose. Determined to start anew, he embarked on a bike tour in the countryside. Unfortunately, during a heavy downpour, an accident occurred, causing him to slip and fall. Luckily, he found himself near a bicycle repair shop where he unexpectedly encountered his high school junior, Park Hyunmin. Hyunmin kindly offered Minseong shelter at his place until the weather improved.Startled by the situation, Hyunmin exclaimed, \"W-What are you doing?\"To which Minseong replied nonchalantly, \"Huh? But I don't wear any clothes when I go to sleep.\"\"Put them back on!\" Hyunmin blurted out in embarrassment.",
