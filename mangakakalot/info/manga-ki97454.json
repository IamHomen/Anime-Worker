  "description": "Description :\r\n        Like the earlier Battle Royales, a class of middle school students are picked to compete in fights to the death on an island until there is only one left. The manga follows the point of view of Girl #10 Makoto Hashimoto, an unlucky girl who fears that her class will be chosen to participate in \"the program,\" a mysterious event that forces students to kill each other. Makoto attends Shikanotoride Junior High School. After the encouragement of her best friend Itou Yamamoto and her mother she decides to face the chances. Her fears are supposedly put to rest when word spreads that all 50 Programs had already been executed in the year making them 100% unlikely to participate... Taken from MangaUpdates This manga was released straight to tankobon (graphic novel) format, therefore there was no serialization. However, a thirty page preview ran in Akita Shoten's Young Champion Magazine. The problem with straight to tankobon manga is that there is no indication whatsoever of when the next volume might be released. Though the author is the same, the artist has changed from the original manga. The realistic grit of Masayuki Taguchi has been replaced by the lighthearted cartooniness of Hitoshi Tomizawa. Also, though it is still written by Koushun Takami, the original story is based on the universe of the films rather than that of the original novel. Taken from AnimeNewsNetwork.",
