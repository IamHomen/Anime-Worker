  "description": "Description :\r\n        In the distant future, battered by a long-forgotten history, humanity is reduced to feeding on commonbread, a kind of prefabricated bread. Far from seeing this as inevitable, young Haruka, an explorer of ruins, has long since discovered traces of other foods that once existed and that she forces herself to find in her research. To do this, she must delve even further into the deserted and abandoned lands, exposed to all dangers, from mutant monsters to merciless looters.\nThe scenario takes the reader on a journey of anticipation reminiscent of the film Soylent Green , where a subtle and effective drawing evokes Tsutomu Nihei and Moebius.",
