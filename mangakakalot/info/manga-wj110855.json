  "description": "Description :\r\n        Once before, Seven mythical Gods appeared on Earth and their battle split the earth and tore the sky. 10 years after the battle, the calamity should have passed already. However. A boy named Shinsen Raika had his true little sister abducted by a god in the battle and was currently standing in the\u300eAcademy\u300fon an artificial island in the distant seas. Here, the night was called as after school time. During that time period, the \u300eGods\u2019 Proxy War\u300f were being held by using Divinity-Compatible people for gaining the seat of the law of world (The supreme God). On the first night, Raika was attacked by the Norse mythological God Brynhildr. With death in front of him, he acquired the detestable power of the gods; the power for revenge. \u300cBecome my slave! Give me not just your hands and legs, but also your fingers, toes, and even your soul!\u300d. Absolute Domination. Using the power from the devil eye of Balor, he tries to take back the world from Gods control. A new heroic mythical saga of a devil eye-user swearing to take revenge on the Gods begins now!",
