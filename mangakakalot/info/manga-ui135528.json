  "description": "Description :\r\n        Subaru, a college student, loses only part of his memory in an accident. It is a memory of \"living together\" with a high school classmate, Soji. At that time, he was sure he hadn't talked to the guy who's cool and popular, unlike himself. Subaru who was discharged from the hospital, started living together, and learned about Soji again. From the surprisingly caring and anxious man, he realised that he was being looked at with a kind gaze he had never seen before\u2026",
