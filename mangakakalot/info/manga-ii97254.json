  "description": "Description :\r\n        Through the looking glass into Camelot Garden, falls a boy named Ryu, whose purpose is to crush this weird, semi-malignant fantasy world. Oh yeah, and the below is a direct quote from the beginning of the story. The Lady of Shallot by Alfred Lord Tennyson There she weaves by night and day A magic web with colours gay. She has heard a whisper say, A curse is on her if she stay To look down to Camelot. But in her web she still delights To weave the mirror\u2019s magic sights: A funeral, with plumes and lights And music, came from Camelot. \u201cI am half-sick of shadows,\u201d said The Lady of Shalott. \u201cTirra lirra, tirra lirra,\u201d Sang Sir Lancelot. She left the web: she left the loom: She looked down to Camelot.",
