  "description": "Description :\r\n        Hardworking, good-looking, and heir to daddy's company, Shimano thinks his life's just about perfect. Except that he's working from the bottom up in the company, and he can't seem to get along with Kurosawa, his manager. Competent but flippant, Kurosawa always seems to pay extra attention to Shimano, whether it's teasing him to make him work harder or covering up for his mistakes, which of course drives Shimano crazy. So he has Kurosawa firmly blacklisted until he realizes that Kurosawa's private life isn't a bundle of roses and begins to sympathize...and how are you supposed to hate someone you sympathize with, anyway? The story is continued in the last two chapters of Tight Rope.",
