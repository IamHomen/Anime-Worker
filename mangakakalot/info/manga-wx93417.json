  "description": "Description :\r\n        Momoko is a fan of Hero shows, like the Power Rangers. The boy she liked in Junior High says mean things about her obsession and breaks her heart. In High School, Momoko tries to reinvent herself, and throws away all her Hero souvenirs. But at school, she is asked to join a Hero Club with 3 tall, handsome members who dress up as Hero characters and patrol the school. They want her to be their Pink Ranger. Even though the other girls are jealous, Momoko is too scarred by her past to embrace her love of Hero stories, and she doesn't get along at all with the Red Ranger.",
