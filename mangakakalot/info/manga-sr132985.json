His partner for the evening is Amekawa, someone he vaguely knew in high school, and what was supposed to be a one-time thing turns into an everyday occurrence. Soon Machiki wonders just what these feelings he's starting to have are, but just what will happen when Amekawa reveals something he's been hiding?+",
