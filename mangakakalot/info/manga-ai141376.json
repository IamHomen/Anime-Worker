  "description": "Description :\r\n        What do the people of the world, the nation's mountains and rivers have to do with me? All of that is irrelevant. What are grudges, vengeance, and cycles of retribution? Cutting the weeds and pulling up the roots naturally puts an end to it all. As for the greater good, I agree with that, Because I am the greater good! And you ask me what the rules are? My words are the rules!  That year, I carried two blades, With a swift motion, I began to strike, Cutting down for three days and nights without blinking an eye. Suddenly, I turned around, Only to find I had wiped out an entire martial world!",
