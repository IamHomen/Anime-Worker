One year ago, her terrible boyfriend made her the joint guarantor on a loan before promptly ghosting her with a mountain of debt. Now she just wants to be left alone to her quiet otaku life, working her office job to make her ex\u2019s monthly repayments, and devoting what scant little is left to her hobbies. Namely, her virtual boyfriend Allen-kun, who is hot, kind, and dependable in a way that real-life men aren\u2019t\u2014least of all the hotshot young VP that keeps getting on her case about deadlines and deliverables. But when said VP shows up with a rather interesting proposal, Maki must decide if she's ready to roll the dice one last time\u2026",
