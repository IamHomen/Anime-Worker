Love-note in hand, Taeko overhears Kanno-sensei being congratulated on his wedding--and his already pregnant bride. Taeko is in shock; she shaped her whole world around Kanno-sensei and now it's all over! Her childhood friend Shin just seems happy to pour fuel on her fire. Taeko lurches from one disaster to another. And every time her plans are ruined Shin seems to be involved. She aches to tell sensei how she really feels. But will Kanno-sensei even care?",
