'The joy of entering the academy under the fake identity of 'Adrian Heather' is short-lived, and he becomes a roommate with the youngest prince. When I really like this play, an unexpected variable arises. In the end, the Gold Dragon ends the play under the guise of death... I forgot about entertainment and spent peaceful days, but was suddenly summoned to the prince's room!? A gold dragon appears in the form of a dead friend in front of the prince who asks him to find his dead friend's body.",
