  "description": "Description :\r\n        Dan Otaka, a young man living in harmony, is finding it difficult to make progress in his work, relationships, and life, and is feeling a little unsatisfied in his daily life. Even though he understands that he must live in the present and aim toward the future, he can't help but wish for a return to his happy childhood. What awaits Dan when he returns to his parents' home in Yamanashi Prefecture is a mysterious \"permission\" to go back to the past and a \"lightning strike\". What awaits Dan when he wakes up are the toys he used to play with, the manga he used to read, the candy he used to eat, and all the things he misses. And right in front of him, he sees himself as a young boy in the Heisei era! Heisei reincarnation, but the destination is inside a toy! Play through the Heisei era once more! A retro nostalgic everyday comedy!",
