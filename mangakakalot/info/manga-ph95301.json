  "description": "Description :\r\n        Kannagi Kazuma was considered useless within his family because he could not use \"Enjutsu\" (lit. Blaze Technique), the power to control flames. When he was defeated by Kannagi Ayano, one of his very distant relatives, in a bout to decide who would wield \"Enraiha\" (lit. Blaze Lightning Supremacy), a sword that was wielded by the family heir, he was banished from the family. Four years later, he returns as a master of \"Fujutsu\" (lit. Wind Technique), the power to control wind, and with a new name, Yagami Kazuma. Soon after his return, he is reunited with Ayano and his younger brother, Ren, who is also gifted in Enjutsu. Soon, however, Kannagi family members are killed and the murder weapon is revealed to be Fujutsu. Now Kazuma has to fight his family to prove that he is not the murderer and follow a series of adventures with Ayano. NOTE: Incomplete due to author passing away.",
