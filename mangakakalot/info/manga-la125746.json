  "description": "Description :\r\n        Onoda Haruichi, who dedicates his youth to Math, distances himself from his surroundings for the sake of his goal. His goal is to represent Japan in the International Math Olympiad (IMO). On the first day of school, a girl who also loves math, Nanase Mami calls out to him. \"Do you like math?\" she asks. His solitary daily life starts to shine as he meets people through math?!\n\nIn the face of getting told by others that their goal is reckless, they earnestly face themselves, they pursue and break new ground as they expand their horizons. These are the boys and girls who love mathematics!\n\nChallenging the festival of geniuses, this is the authentic and passionate world of the Math Olympiad.",
