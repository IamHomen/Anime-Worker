Akiyama, your typical glasses wearing otaku, works part-time with Nakamura, a gyaru from the same university. However, he has never tried talking to her before because he thinks \"otakus and gyarus live in different universe\". But then one day, all of a sudden Nakamura-san rolls into Akiyama's house, where he lives alone...? And now get this, Nakamura-san, who is usually not afraid to show her sexy side and puts up a strong, confident blushes right away! A romantic comedy about a gyaru and an otaku living together!",
