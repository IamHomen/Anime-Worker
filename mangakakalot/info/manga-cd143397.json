Why did you save me?\"\nThe man was curious.\nIt was natural.\nThe woman was his sworn enemy.\nAnd their rivalry should have ended there.\nThe final act was to be his death.\nThose he believed were his subordinates stabbed him in the back, and even more enemies rushed to target him.\n\"Answer me. Why did you keep me alive!\"\n\"Don't cry...\"\n\"Am I... crying?\"\nHot tears were flowing from eyes he thought had dried up long ago.\n\"Just think of it as a bad dream. A very painful and terrible dream.\"\n\"But if our time together held any value at all.\"\n\"Even at the end of this nightmare, please find me again.\"\nThump thump thump thump.\nThe mountain of corpses began to rumble.\nSimultaneously, beyond the blood-red earth, numerous flags rose amidst a hazy dust.\n\"Uaaaaaah!\"\nThe man roared upon seeing the massive blood-colored flag.\n\"Mangcheon Assembly! I won't let you get away with this.\"\nWill Cho Un-hwi, who has been given a new life, be able to find his bride-to-be?",
