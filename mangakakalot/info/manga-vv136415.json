  "description": "Description :\r\n        \"If you do good deeds in the human world for one year, you will regain all your powers.'' Ides, a supreme demon, loses a battle with her rival god, Ferdinand, and has to live as a saint in the human world. But something is not quite right. Unlike when she was a demon, Ides now has a sickly body that will collapse if she does not do a good deed. She cannot speak ill of anyone, nor can she attack humans... Then the emperor Raiden, who looks just like the god Ferdinand, appears before her. \"What a cute saint.''**Links:**- (https://www.comico.jp/comic/9323)",
