  "description": "Description :\r\n        For the first time in a long time, Rentaro's visiting a remote, relatively unknown village named Oinu - where he and his mother used to live. Rentaro can't remember much of where he spent his carefree childhood, and he definitely doesn't remember anything about Oinu's summer festival or its mysterious rural superstitions. Could the quiet, strangely helpful Shiro have the answers to all of Rentaro's questions?",
