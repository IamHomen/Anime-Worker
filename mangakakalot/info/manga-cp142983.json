  "description": "Description :\r\n        It was his cruel words that ended my seven-year unrequited love. \"I have a man I love. I need your help.\" Words that crossed my chest flowed through his thin, red lips, which I had loved since they first met. \"But that person is not interested in me at all.\" \"I hope you help me. I think you know me very well.\" I didn't know what or how I could help, but I nodded. I felt like I would burst into tears if I opened my mouth, so there was no other way than to nod my head repeatedly.",
