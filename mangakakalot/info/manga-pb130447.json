  "description": "Description :\r\n        Haru Kurosaki once heard a stranger's song in high school that made him decide to finally follow his passions. Now, he's a graphic designer who's recently been put in charge of designing a CD jacket for the prodigy musical artist Eddie Astley.On the outside, Eddie is intimidating and aloof \u2014 but when Haru spots him at a rock concert, he realizes how wrong that assumption is. As he sees beyond Eddie's surly exterior and catches a glimpse of the man beneath the affectation, Haru begins to think about the message and emotions that Eddie tries to convey through his music. And in trying to get to know more about Eddie for his design project, he discovers that music always has a way of transporting you to a vital moment from the past.",
