  "description": "Description :\r\n        s a member of the \"Nine Road\" for decades, I've traveled the world preventing global catastrophes. My long-awaited retirement was finally within reach. At 56 years old, what awaited me was the fame of being a battle-hardened veteran who had reached the highest EX rank, and countless accolades as humanity's hero and Earth's guardian! All that was left was to truly enjoy a life of wealth and glory! And just as I was about to settle into a comfortable retirement... \"Aaaargh! This can't be happening!\" I woke up to find myself as my 24-year-old self from 32 years ago! Even worse, I'm back in the past when I had absolutely nothing!!! \"I wasn't supposed to be the regressor!\" Moreover, Nicholas from the Nine Road was meant to be the returner. Does this mean I have to gather the Nine Road myself from scratch? A life forced to start over as an unexpected regressor! This time, I'll finish things quicker and try to enjoy life.",
