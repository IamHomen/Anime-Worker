  "description": "Description :\r\n        I not only reincarnated into someone who died in an absurd fashion, but I also took the crown prince's place and went to the secret neutral territory, where male members of the five imperial families gathered. As a result... my childhood friends know me as a boy.\n\n\u201cGoodbye, guys.\" I cried in front of my friends who I would never meet again. That was because officially, I (the prince) was going to die soon!\n\nIt was fun spending time with them, but I will never see them again. I hope everyone lives happily!\n\n***\n\nAfter many years, my childhood friends turned heroes who defeated the wild dragon visited me.\n\n\"Was it you? The one who killed my friend?\"\n\n\u201cAfter killing the previous crown prince, the murderer is said to be living comfortably as a princess, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will torture you, so much so you'll wish for death.\" \n\n\"Answer me. Why did you kill him?\u201d\n\nOf course, they didn't recognize me at all. No, that's not the problem... the problem is that my childhood friends are trying to kill me. Wait a second, guys!",
