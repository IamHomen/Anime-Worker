  "description": "Description :\r\n        At the age of eight, I realised I had reincarnated as the nefarious last boss of an otome game, Queen Pride. Her fighting strength is high because she\u2019s the last boss who will fight with the capture target, and her superior cunning wits make her the most powerful first princess in a matriarchal country. Since she brings misfortune to all that surrounds her, what awaits is a future of ruination! \u2026really, wouldn\u2019t it be better if I died?In this case, I\u2019ll avoid destruction from the capture target and freely use my authority and cheat abilities to save everyone!---**Note: This manga is continuation of the canceled manga, be sure to read that one first (check the related tab)**",
