  "description": "Description :\r\n        Emily, the only daughter of an earl, is looking for a marriage partner to inherit the title. Kyle, the captain of the Order of the Holy Knights, appears before her at just the right time. \n\n\u2018I need you,\u2019 he says, \u2018and you need a suitable husband.\u2019 \n\nThe two agree to pretend to be married for the duration of the contract. But Emily falls for Kyle during their fake marriage, and soon the three years are over and their contract comes to an end. However, Kyle returns from an expedition with an unexpected case of amnesia. \n\n\u2018So does that mean he doesn\u2019t remember the marriage contract?\u2019 Emily thought, realising that if Kyle knew, he would be horrified.",
