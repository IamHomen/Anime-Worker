  "description": "Description :\r\n        The long awaited comic book adaption of the popular work that won first place in the overall PIXIV ranking!Ko, a party-goer college student, leads a flashy campus life. Yet he's actually an unassuming guy and, secrelty, a closeted gay otaku. His goal is to \"get a fashionable boyfriend\"!!! Unfortunately, he's never met anyone, nor has the courage to come out. Then one day, Tanaka, whom Ko meets at his favorite game story, suddenly confesses to him. Tanaka is a fellow otaku and the two have a great affinity, but what if Ko simply isn't willing to accept his dull and tacky appearance...?The happiest, most bittersweet coming-of-age love comedy, dedicated to all otakus who hate themselves and crave to change!",
