This year's Thesis Competition is being held in Kyoto sponsored by the Magic Association and in their conference hall.

So, two siblings have an encounter of the fate with the \u201cGenius Augmented Magician\u201d. Conspiracy of the ancient city was the stage. The fate that has continued to smolder away in the back of the history of magician development, Tatsuya and Miyuki and his companions are challenged.\n\nAdaption of Light Novel Volumes 14-15.",
