  "description": "Description :\r\n        Rennosuke, a scion of the influential Toudou Group, has a terrible relationship with his family. He spends his days getting told off by his father and older sister, who say things like \"Did you get into a fight again?\" \"Having a delinquent for a son of the Toudou family is an embarrassment\". One day, Rennosuke chances upon a hungry child. The sight of that child hungrily devouring a piece of bread reminds Rennosuke of the dog he once owned, and he asks half-jokingly \"If you don't have anywhere to go, why don't you come to my place?\".  The child then comes to the Toudou house and starts working as a maid.",
