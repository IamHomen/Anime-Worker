  "description": "Description :\r\n        Sonezaki Keiichi is popular... Too popular for his own good. Too popular for his own peace of mind. He hates it. He hates how most people look at him once and fall head over heels for him. The rest of them just hate him for that popularity. So he keeps to himself and only complains to his brother, Megumi. Until one day Megumi invites Takamiya Natsuki home. Just like the others, Natsuki's face shows the same expression of falling for Keiichi. But somehow, that look gives Keiichi goosebumps, rather than makes him sick. What is this? Why is that? He is baffled by it, so he sets out to find the answers!",
