  "description": "Description :\r\n        The main character, Noah, is a reincarnated person. He was active as a sword saint in a previous life, and as a sage in another. But he\u2019s been forced to work hard all his life, and he\u2019s sick of being a hero!One day, Noah dies and wakes up to find that he has been reborn as a prince. He had a high level of magical talent and the swordsmanship of a sword saint, but he didn\u2019t want to get busy again, so Noah pretended to be incompetent with all his might.Then, on his 15th birthday. A skill appraisal revealed that he was incompetent (actually, he was just hiding it with his concealment skill). Noah was scorned and banished. With what seemed like a gesture of warmth, his father gave him a remote territory.\u201cNow I\u2019ll enjoy my second life!\u201d Noah was enthusiastic, but he didn\u2019t know.Actually, the territory was in the devil\u2019s forest, which is said to be uninhabitable. But his past life was more advanced compared to this one, and the level of human beings in this world was lower. Noah\u2019s ability is revealed when he helps a girl who was attacked by a monster in the forest.\u201cAmazing!!! Noah-sama defeated a dragon with a single blow!\u201d\u201cHow did this happen? Ahhhhh!\u201dOn the other hand, the royal family also noticed Noah\u2019s ability and came to take him back, but it was too late. At that time, Noah was already being praised by the people as the lord of the Demon Forest.",
