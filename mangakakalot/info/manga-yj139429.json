  "description": "Description :\r\n        Seto, an office worker, enjoyed being pampered as \"Rabi,\" his beautiful female gaming avatar. One day, his cheerful junior Kujou, just back from abroad, was assigned to work under him. Despite Seto's gloominess, Kujou wanted to befriend him and approached him. Though initially bewildered, Seto, with zero love experience, was quickly knocked out by Kujou's smile\u2026!?\nThat night, still troubled by this unknown situation, Seto began interacting with people as Rabi in-game and was shocked when \"Jack,\" an old acquaintance, suddenly appeared. To his surprise, it was Kujou, the source of his worries! Determined to keep his IRL identity a secret (Rabi = Seto), and maybe a little too conscious of Kujou, he ended up having a wet dream about him \u2013 and then he even let that fact slip\u2026!?\nGloomy bachelor x inexperienced otaku\u2014a double life love comedy!",
