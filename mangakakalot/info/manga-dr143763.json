  "description": "Description :\r\n        The manga's story teases of a boy who thinks everything in the world is worthless: the heroes who pretend to fight with grace, his classmates who only know how to flock together, and his own weak, miserable self. That is why the boy aspires to be the lonely, solitary, and ultimate villain, to change himself and the world.",
