  "description": "Description :\r\n        From Aerandria Scans: A collection of love stories! When you meet your special person, what do you do when you find out that he\u2019s evil? After living like a doll for most of your life, is it possible to change? A chance meeting with a boy changes the life of a girl with an illness forever, but that meeting doesn\u2019t seem to matter to the other person. Loving a younger guy can be really tough, especially when you look like a child while he looks like an adult! Each story is heartwarming and sweet.",
