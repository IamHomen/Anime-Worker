  "description": "Description :\r\n        In a not-too-distant future, there lies a royal city where a tyranny of nobles, greedy for power and self-interest, prevails, using the weakened royal authority as an excuse. Among them, Ray Arisa lives in a shabby bookstore in a corner of a brothel alley, where the lowest class of people resides. He would have been able to take care of himself, but a terrible illness has been following him, and poverty has been his only family for a long time. The only painkiller that spares Ray from the pain is finding a partner at a gay bar for a one-night stand, engaging in sexual pleasure.\nOne day, after engaging with two large men who were interested in him at the same time, one of them started to infiltrate Ray\u2019s life little by little. Contrary to his straight appearance, a man with promiscuous sex habits approached Ray without hesitation and did him a favor for no known reason. After being sweet-talked by a man who has everything suspicious about him, Ray ended up continuing the relationship with him despite knowing that the man is like a sugar coated poison.",
