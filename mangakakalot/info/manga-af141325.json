  "description": "Description :\r\n        Author Park Jonghwa (pen name Bish) of the romance fantasy novel \"Beyond the Time of Dawn\" experiences a bus accident while heading to his novel event caf. Expecting severe injuries, Jonghwa opens his eyes to find himself not in a hospital bed but in a strange one, and to his surprise, it's in the world of his own novel. Moreover, he's not the protagonist or even a supporting character but has somehow possessed an extra role. Determined to return to reality, Jonghwa begins planning an ending, adhering to the unwritten law of isekai stories. However, things take an unexpected turn as the supporting male character, Ronen, starts acting strangely. Witness the tear-jerking tale of a writer who, along with his readers, ventures into his own novel and cannot escape without shedding a tear, in the ultimate isekai escape story!+",
