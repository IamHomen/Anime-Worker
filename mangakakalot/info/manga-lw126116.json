  "description": "Description :\r\n        [Just as your birth did not inspire me, so your death won't mean anything to me.]Jaina reincarnated as a supporting character who was born as mixed blood of human-dragon and died miserably after being neglected. She is branded as an unclean entity and was abandoned by the dragons.And the first time she met her father, the lord of the tower, Diamide, he just looked at her coldly, as though he didn't feel any sense of intimacy to his daughter as described in the original.\u201dIs that the one you called my daughter?\u201dJaina flinched as he approached and lowered her sight.\u201dBlue eyes\u2026 but that's not a proof that she's my daughter. You could have brought me a child born with another human.\u201dAnd so he went back leaving her alone and Jaina was living in the shabby warehouse of the tower.Rather than making vain efforts to get into the eyes of his father, the lord of the tower, she decided to have a small luxury that she had never experienced even in her previous life before her death.\u201dYou don't have to think of me as your daughter. I won't call you father either.\u201d\u201d\u2026\u201d\u201dTower's lord?\u201dSo is the father, who should've been indifferent, starting to get obsessed? Father, can you just leave me alone?",
