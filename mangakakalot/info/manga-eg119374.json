  "description": "Description :\r\n        After two hundred years, A young alchemist known as Marielle wakes from her slumber.\n\nThe Kingdom of Endarisa had been brought to ruin by the stampeding 'Forest of Demons.' Although Marielle managed to escape by using the power of 'Living Death,' she made a clumsy mistake,and ended up sleeping for two hundred years.\n\nThe age in which she awoke was a completely new world. Here alchemists were all but extinct and potions could only be afforded by the rich and powerful.\n\nAs a result, Marielle ended up being the only alchemist in the city. Despite this she still sets out to lead a quiet and leisurely life in this strange new world. Although it's two hundred years in the future, she'll still live life her own way.",
