  "description": "Description :\r\n        Akito has quite the quirk ? coffee gets him drunk, to a very salacious degree. That's why he avoids getting involved with people and works in food delivery. When delivering to a particular customer, he accidentally spills some coffee and gets drunk on the smell. After clinging to the man with his face upturned, the two spend the night together. He makes excuses for why it happened ? he was coerced, it's his body's fault ? but he wants that man to make him feel good again... So which one of them started this, really ? the obsessive desirable guy or the delivery man with the super ho*** disposition?+",
