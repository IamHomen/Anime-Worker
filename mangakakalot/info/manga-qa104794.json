  "description": "Description :\r\n        Something strange has happened to Makoto Konno. Time has suddenly stopped and moved her backwards. With her newly discovered ability to literally leap backwards in time Makoto finds that tests become a piece of cake, embarrassing situations are corrected, and she can have her favourite food anytime she wants. Unfortunately, her carefree time travelling has adverse effects on the people she cares for. With every successful leap Makoto somehow alters the fate of those around her. This wasn't supposed to happen and as she races back in time to fix everything, she notices that her abilities are not limitless but with every successful jump she's one step closer to discovering the most wonderful secret in her young adult life. Leap into the adventure of a lifetime with Makoto Konno! Based on the 2006 animated film, which was in turn loosely based on the 1965 novel. Source: MADMAN",
