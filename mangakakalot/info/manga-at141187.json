You're the only one who can save it, Emo.\"\nThe war is won, but the wheat farming is ruined! The empire of Lipolka is plagued by famine, a curse cast by a demon who lost a battle to a warrior just before he died. I, Eudemonia Plenus, was born to this land with the knowledge of my previous life, with the historical mission of improving the food culture of the continent!\nPeople are starving to death for lack of food, yet they eat no potatoes, no sweet potatoes, no tomatoes... The little lord's continental version of the 'three meals a day' project!\nWhat can I do when my mind is an adult from a previous life, but my body is a baby? Ouch, big trouble!",
