  "description": "Description :\r\n        Compilation of short stories: \u2022 Hotel It is the year 2272 A.D. A computer continues to live on in order to complete a mission in a world where all life, including Mankind, has gone extinct. This is a record of those 27 million years of its heroic struggle. \u2022 Present Hanako suffers from a terrible disease. After awakening from a deep slumber, Hanako has only three days to live. During those three days, her husband, Takao, must endure a heart-breaking experience, knowing that the person Hanako really loves isn't him. \u2022 Subete wa Maguro no Tame da (It Was All for the Tuna) Tuna have become extinct and Jun Shiozaki will do everything possible and imaginable to bring them back. \u2022 Stephanos Set in modern-day Japan, our main character Noriko finds out that she is pregnant with her lover Matsumura\u2019s baby. He, however, is an important doctor with a family and everything already. Noriko wants to have the baby, but Matsumura says that it\u2019s actually a rapidly growing cancer and that they have to remove it immediately. It might also be neither of these things\u2026 \u2022 Diadem A \"Diadem\" is a word for 'crown' that has its root in Greek. \"Stephanos\", which appeared in \"Mandala\" 01, was also a 'crown'. It seems that we could consider this the second work in a continuing series of shorts that should perhaps be called a \"Crown series\".",
