Game over means actual 'death' ---- The ten thousand who have logged onto the as of yet mysterious game 'Sword Art Online' have been forced into this perilous death game. Protagonist Kirito, one of the many gamers, has greeted this 'truth'. He plays as a solo player in the giant castle that is the stage for this game ---- 'Aincrad'. To meet the conditions of clearing the game --- getting through all 100 floors, Kirito fights his way through this quest alone.",
