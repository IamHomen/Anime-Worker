The school pairs each aspiring songwriter with an aspiring idol, but Haruka finds herself paired with 3 idols! To make things more difficult, Nanami is also not allowed to date any of her beautiful partners! ___________________________ Nanami Haruka is a shy teenage girl who has a dream to become a talented song writer. She is accepted by Saotome Gakuen, an elite entertainment industry school developed for the sole purpose of nurturing future idols. The classes are taught by famous idols; facilities include top notch recording studios and live theaters. Most importantly, only a small portion of the most talented, natural born idol students are allowed into the prestigious Shining Agency after graduation and introduced to the nation. The school randomly pairs up a singer to a song writer but as fate would have it, Haruka ends up being paired with 3 very different boys all striving to become the next big idol; Ittoki Otoya is upbeat and lively, Shinomiya Natsuki is bright and intelligent, Hijirikawa Masato is cool and calm. Haruka, determined to make all three boys into future idols must work harder than anyone else and overcome her shy personality if she wants to reach her dream.",
