  "description": "Description :\r\n        Juggling work, raising her daughter, and taking care of the house, every day is a struggle just to survive for wife and mother, Yuri. Despite this, the only thing her husband Yuto does to help out is pick their daughter up from the nursery. Although Yuri isn't entirely happy with the status quo, they live a relatively happy life together. But one day, she discovers a familiar sweet scent and a long, black hair on her husband's shirt when doing the laundry. Suspicious, she takes a peek at her husband's texts and finds an intimate conversation between him and their daughter's favorite homeroom teacher at the nursery, Miss Moe!",
