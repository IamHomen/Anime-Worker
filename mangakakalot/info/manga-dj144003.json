Yet, among them, Sol Rock stood apart from the rest. Branded as a worthless support mage and treated like a mere expendable grunt. One day, after completing their promotion quest, he was told he wasn\u2019t strong enough to keep up and was kicked out. What they didn\u2019t know was that Sol Rock possessed the greatest power of all: the \u201cPlayer,\u201d a godlike talent that allows him to buff his allies and dominate the battlefield. Now, cast out and alone, Sol Rock is determined to prove his worth. He sets out to gather the strongest group the world has ever seen!",
