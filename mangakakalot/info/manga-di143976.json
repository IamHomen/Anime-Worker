  "description": "Description :\r\n        Enchanters possess special talents that set them apart from the average human. They are recognized by their ability to manipulate Chi. However, some use their abilities for personal gain. Some rise against Enchanters to uncover the secrets of the world. Others seek to become the highest power or simply wish to erase Enchanters from existence. Even if it\u2019s destiny, karma, or nature, in the Enchanter world, one must understand the blur between life and death.",
