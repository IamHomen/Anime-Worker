  "description": "Description :\r\n        Dragon of the Beginning and Dragon of the Last is a series of interconnected oneshots in a high fantasy setting which take place millennia apart and portray the evolution of dragon-human interaction through the point of view of different characters.\n\nStory 1: Three people cross paths, united by a flood and a dragon. A man who lost his village. An old man who lost his child. A young woman who lost her people.\n\nStory 2: The king is ill. In their quest to find a cure, a priest and his band of soldiers enter barbarian territory. But the herb they need belongs to the dragons.\n\nStory 3: Dragonswood is home to dragons and the people who care for them. When a mage and his dragon are captured, however, war looms ever closer.\n\nStory 4: After a ritual gone wrong, a dry spell hits a village once abundant in rain. The arrival of a rainmaker promises salvation, but first he must get to the bottom of a well-kept secret.",
