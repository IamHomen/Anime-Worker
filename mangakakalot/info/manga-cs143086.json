  "description": "Description :\r\n        \"People around me called me a sage who was obsessed with the Philosopher's Stone.\"\nThere was once a man who mastered magic and was known as a sage. Realizing that creating the Philosopher's Stone was impossible with his current body, he took a gamble. He decided to reincarnate into a future world as a different person to obtain a new, stronger body. \nHis reincarnation was successful, and he gained the body of a cute boy named Mars, marked with the emblem of strength, the \"Pure Seal.\" However, in the future, this emblem was inexplicably regarded as a \"Defective Seal\"...! \nAll for the sake of the Philosopher's Stone, the journey of the strongest sage begins anew!",
