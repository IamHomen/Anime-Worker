  "description": "Description :\r\n        I was reincarnated into this novel\u2026 Wait, no!I was reincarnated 10 years before the events of the novel took place? The setting of the novel is a prison that\u2019s even worse than hell itself. This and that happened, and ten years flew by. I\u2019m now the top dog of this prison.*\u201cHey, Mint. I\u2019ve got a job for you. Get working.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying all this stuff, but I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201dDespite being the top dog, I pretend to be an idiot. But I\u2019m fine with that. It\u2019s one of the plus sides of being dead.\u201cPretend to be dead on paper. In exchange, I\u2019ll do something for you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Then an opportunity crept up like a sweet, sweet lie. \u201cIf you help me, I\u2019ll release you from this prison.\u201d\u201cWhat shall I do for you, Master?\u201d\u201c....\u201dWith those words, the prison warden was able to order around the prison idiot. \u201cThere\u2019s a new inmate that\u2019s being brought in. Make him the new top dog of the prison.\u201dThis place is called a prison, but within these walls is total anarchy. As long as I can make this guy the new top dog, I\u2019ll be free of this place at last. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to have to go over to the men\u2019s prison.\u201d\u201c...Eh? Do you really think I\u2019ve got the parts for the job?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be in disguise, a disguise!\u201dBut alas! The new inmate is the male lead of the novel.",
