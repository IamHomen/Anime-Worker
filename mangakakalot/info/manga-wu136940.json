Wu FengXian, an extraordinary young man with a peculiar destiny and seemingly inept magical abilities but outstanding combat skills, is the sole heir to the Wu family legacy and the designated servant of the deity chosen by the fox spirit guarding their home. Unfortunately, his unique destiny attracts unwanted attention, leading him to leave the rural area where strange phenomena frequently occur. However, urban legends and supernatural tales continue to follow Wu FengXian.Despite his passionate spirit, Wu FengXian faces repeated setbacks due to his limited strength. Faced with the choice between exerting effort and taking it easy, he relies on his personal charm to opt for the latter. Wu FengXian, with a burning sense of justice, strives to save and protect the land passed down through generations, preventing the infiltration of the dark forces from Fengdu. Additionally, he seeks to cultivate a romantic relationship with his beloved sister. Wu FengXian confronts the challenges posed by his unique and deficient destiny, eventually defying fate, combating demons, and awakening the deity to fulfill his mission.",
