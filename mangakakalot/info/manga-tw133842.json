Demian's abilities have earned him the respect of those around him, but after an injury and the mistake in a game, he has lost his confidence. Although he tries his best to rehabilitate himself, Demian suddenly feels as if his upper body is frozen while playing. When he consulted a doctor, he was told that it was a symptom of the \"yips\". This is a \"rise after the fall\" story.",
