  "description": "Description :\r\n        From Stiletto Heels: After a fall-out with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s family, Hikaru\u2019s older brother, Kaname, brings home a new girlfriend named Narita Tsugumi or \u201cTsugumi-chan\u201d. Everyone in his family, including Hikaru, is shocked when they open the door to find a woman who looks exactly like Kaname\u2019s ex-girlfriend, but she is ushered into his room before the secret can be revealed. Hikaru accidentally finds out that she is working at Bar Clap, and that personality-wise, she is the exact opposite of Kaname\u2019s ex-girlfriend. Even though Tsugumi-chan swears him to secrecy, Hikaru is touched by her loneliness and unconditional love for his brother, and begins struggling with the weight of the truth and his newfound feelings. (Contains two other oneshots)",
