  "description": "Description :\r\n        In high school, Toyoki Ashihara befriends Yu and Haru, identical twins who often switch places with each other as a joke. But, when Toyoki reveals that he can tell them both apart the twins stop. Overtime, the twins stop their gags and start cutting and dying their hair to make it easier to know who is who. Their friendship seems to go smoothly until it fades away when they graduate high school. Years later, Toyoki and Yu reunite at Haru's funeral...but is this really Haru's funeral?+",
