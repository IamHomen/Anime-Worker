  "description": "Description :\r\n        \"Don't you want me? Sure... eat me.\" A cakeverse BL story between an admired senior and an honor student library committee member! In this world, there are beings called \"forks\" and \"cakes.\" \"Forks\" are predators, and \"cakes\" are prey. Both look and live like normal humans, but the only difference is that forks have no sense of taste. However, they can only taste the bodily fluids of cakes, and the taste is so sweet that some forks cannot resist their desire and commit crimes. Forks are often said to be potential criminals, and Tatsunari, who is popular at school, lives his life hiding the fact that he is a fork. One day, when he saves a junior library committee member who is the honor student from an accident, he feels that his sweat in his mouth is \"sweet\"... It's delicious, it feels good... he can't stop loving him--+",
