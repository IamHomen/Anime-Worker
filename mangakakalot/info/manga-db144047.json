Now that his dream has come to be realized, he was partnered with Detective Mahori Koudia, who just happened to quit working in headquarters and decided to go back to work in the precinct. Then all of a sudden, Dai-san stole a kiss from Tora-san but Tora-san knows that there's more going on between Sagara Kanrikan and Dai-san than what they are letting on... or is there?!?",
