Ilze is the wife who tries to disrupt the relationship between the protagonist, Gilbert, and the heroine, and her tragic fate ends with her falling into a brothel.\nTo avoid this dreadful fate, Ilze decided to peacefully ask Gilbert for a divorce. She thought that if she could change the ending, she might be able to enjoy life in this new world. However, her plans didn\u2019t go as expected, as Gilbert suddenly appears in her room and starts behaving in unpredictable ways.",
