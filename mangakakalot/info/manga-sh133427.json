  "description": "Description :\r\n        Shia, a rare beastman who lives deep within the hunting grounds of the mountains, was one day captured by Ryan, a \u2018rare beast\u2019 hunter. Rare beasts that resemble humans (beastmen) are often besieged for their horns and fur, which can be sold at high prices. It seems that Ryan hates beastkin, but when he undresses Shia says \"If you weren't a rare beast, I would have killed you\".This is a love story between an arrogant village head and a beast in human form.",
