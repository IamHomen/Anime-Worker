  "description": "Description :\r\n        Mozuno Nie is a small, timid boy with a weak personality, often targeted by delinquents, or stumbling into open manholes\u2014just a typical \"prey type\" with a knack for attracting trouble. One day, an obvious extrovert, a dark-skinned gyaru named Kakao, enters his life. With her loose-fitting uniform, a chest that seems ready to burst, and surprisingly well-defined abs, she's the complete opposite of Mozuno. She takes an interest in him, calling him \"Prey\" and making him the target of her \"hunt\"... but what could she be after!?",
