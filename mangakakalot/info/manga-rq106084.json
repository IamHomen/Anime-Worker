  "description": "Description :\r\n        In an alternative world where science and a sprinkle of magic reside together, there exists 'Number 9', a robotic servant for a young lord with an interest in machinery. One day, she visits a magical shoe shop asking for a pair of shoes that can \"stop dreams\". What could this possibly mean, and how will her relationship with her master end? Devilish Holly: It is a very cute story, well written out. But it feels like it could continue whenever the author wants it to. It is a really good story and I recommened to everyone! ^^",
