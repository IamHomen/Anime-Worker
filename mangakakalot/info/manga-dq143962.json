  "description": "Description :\r\n        Within the dim corridors of an ancient library resides Sohwa, a mystical dokkaebi (goblin) with a flame that burns both fierce and gentle. Her presence is a haunting melody to the restless soul of Yunwoo, a young master who dares to stake his very essence for the chance to hold her love. Through lifetimes that weave heartbreak and longing, and in a dance of reincarnations fraught with missed steps, their bond teeters between destiny and despair. Can the embers of their love reignite amidst the ashes of fate, or is their passion fated to flicker out in the winds of time?",
