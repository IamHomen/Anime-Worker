  "description": "Description :\r\n        In modern Japan there are seven \"Kings\" who share power with their fellow clansmen. The Blue King Reishi Munakata, the leader of the Blue Clan \"Scepter 4,\" held great responsibilities on his back. The tower that Gold King Daikaku Kokuj\u014dji supervised called the \"Dresden Slate\" was still on his mind, and he felt a great burden by killing the previous Red King, Mikoto Suoh. On the other hand, the former Red Clan \"HOMRA\" clansman Anna Kushina experienced the attacks from the Green Clan \"Jungle\" and awakened as the next Red King. By doing this, she bound her comrades through a strong bond once again. Finally, White Clan members Neko and Kuroh believe that the White King Yashiro is still alive, and seek his whereabouts. However, it was not just them searching for the White King. With \"Jungle\" once again jumping back into action, the fates of the various Kings are brought together.",
