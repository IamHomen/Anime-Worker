  "description": "Description :\r\n        Due to an unidentified virus, which has affected the world, many people have turned into man-eating monsters and the screams of dying people have been swallowed by the cries of monsters.'Kim Jongdo,' a boy who lived a grim life because he didn't receive the attention of those around him due to his inherent lack of presence, survived the apocalypse because he didn't receive attention from the monsters either, and for some reason, Kim Jongdo was also able to speak with some monsters.While soothing loneliness by communicating with the monsters, he meets a girl 'Jo Myeong' who was in the same class as him during high school by chance.Unlike the indifference around him, she was one of the few people who treated Kim Jongdo with interest, and that's how Kim Jongdo's \"no presence\" began to shake.",
