  "description": "Description :\r\n        Sequel to Memory of the Future (Mirai no Kioku) Kento is mild-mannered, straightforward and quite honestly, a bit boring. At 26 he's landed his first full-time position teaching at high school and does everything he can to make his grandparents, who took him in to raise after his parents' tragic death, proud of him. Unfortunately Kento is gay... and they ~don't~ approve. Enter Akira, a ticking-time bomb with a perpetual evil smirk, a ridiculously flamboyant wardrobe and a tendency to hit on anything that moves. Akira's everything Kento isn't... including drop-dead gorgeous and mindbendingly annoying. It's almost a miracle that the two of them have been dating for over a year!! But after all that time, Akira's still keeping some secrets... secrets that aren't going to reflect well on Kento's choice in a partner. Would Kento's grandparents ever survive the shock of their son dating the child of a sex-worker and an alien? Or will they, as Akira puts it, \"cough up their pacemakers\"?! Does Kento care more about his family's opinion of him, or his high-maitanance lover's deep-seated social inferiority complex? An extremely sweet (and funny) story of two people who couldn't be more different, or more perfect for each other. (from doki doki)",
