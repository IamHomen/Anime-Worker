  "description": "Description :\r\n        \u201c\u2026Fueh? W-What is it?\u201d\n\nWhen the shut-in girl Terakomari, or Komari for short, woke up from her slumber, she had been appointed as a commander! And if that wasn\u2019t enough, the corps she holds responsibility over is known for overthrowing and murdering their superiors! Even though she had been born into a prestigious vampire family, because she can\u2019t drink any blood, she possesses close to no athletic or physical abilities, she\u2019s rather small for her age, and she can\u2019t even use any magic.\n\nMet with endless despair, her trusted (?) maid Vill comes to the rescue.\n\n\u201cPlease leave it to me, Komari-sama. I will definitely make sure you won\u2019t be found out!\u201d\n\nThus begins the comical fantasy portraying Komari\u2019s struggles. She\u2019s a shut-in, but she can actually do it if she puts her mind to it!?\n\nThe Popular Novel is now in Manga form!",
