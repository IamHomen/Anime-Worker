  "description": "Description :\r\n        ! You can now more accurately assess the condition of the child who needs your help.>\nEdith Irene Bruxelles had one secret: she had experienced possession.\nOne day, out of nowhere, she became Edith. Not only that, she was in a completely different era, in a strange country she had never heard of before!\nAnd, on top of that, she had an unusual ability that others couldn't see.\nTo return to her original life, Edith chose to enter into a contractual marriage with a genius sorcerer Duke.\n\"Will you marry me?\"\n\"Yes! I\u2019d love to!\"\nHowever...\n\"What\u2019s going on? Do you really think you\u2019re the Duchess of the Duke\u2019s family?\"\n\"Bruxelles? Has anyone even heard of that family?\"\nThe nobles reject her because she comes from a fallen family.\n\"Actually, this is great!\"\nShe thinks positively and goes about her life, but she keeps running into children who are struggling behind the social scenes.\n>\n\"Miss, could you please hold the child's hand?\"\nUnable to watch any longer, she steps in, and before she knows it, she becomes known as the \"fixer.\"\n\"Duchess, I was hoping we could meet privately next week.\"\n\"I\u2019d like that too. Would you be able to come to our residence?\"\nThe story of how I, once an outcast in high society, became the top invitee.\nFinally adjusting to the changed atmosphere, now her husband is acting strangely.\n\"Is that something you normally say you like?\"\n\"Well, I guess so?\"\n\"If that's the case, then what I like is you.\"\nOh my, who in the world confesses like that!?\n(Source: Kakao Page, edited)",
