  "description": "Description :\r\n        Read manhwa Contractual Relationships with Friends Should be Done Carefully / Be Careful of Contractual Relationships With Friends /    \"Oh my, from childhood friends to an engaged couple! Isn't that so romantic?\" \"Yeah. No, it's not.\" \"You two were always together back in the academy, right?\" \"Ah, that's true.\" It all began during our academy days. I was exhausted from the constant stream of marriage proposals. What about me?' What?' As your marriage partner.' And so, I ended up signing a contract engagement with my friend, Aivert! Thus, we began acting like a couple who couldn't live without each other. Of course, I can swear that he's just a friend. But as time passed, and when the end of the contract was approaching \"Soon, I'll be free!\" I thought the embarrassing couple act would soon be over! But Clank. An unexpected event occurred. I stared, bewildered, at the handcuffs now on both my wrist and Aivert's. What kind of situation is this? * I thought we'd just be stuck together, and as long as we did our part, everything would be fine. After all, acting as a couple would get easier, right? I kept thinking positively about it, but Holding the key to the handcuffs, Aivert Royden subtly tilted his head. \"If I break this, would you be disappointed?\" Rodella's eyes went wide. The shy and cautious childhood friend from her memories was gone, replaced by a stranger, yet someone familiar. He wore a look that stirred strange feelings in her. \"You said it yourself. A madman should be tied up.\" Clank. He shook his bound wrist. \"If I take this off\" If I drift away from you, if I let this opportunity slip away \"I think I might go crazy. What should I do?\"",
