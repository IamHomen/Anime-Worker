  "description": "Description :\r\n        I was poor and with no one looking out for me, I was struggling financially. Because of this, I had trouble adjusting to school as well.\n\nMy only hobby was reading a fantasy web novel\u00a0 and imagining that I could become the main character of it. One day, after falling asleep and imagining this as usual... I woke up but instead of becoming the heroine, I'd become the villainess, Louise Sweeney, who meets a terrible ending.\n\n\"Since I know the original novel, if I just avoid falling in love at first sight with the male lead, I definitely won't have a tragic ending!\" Thinking this, Louise avoids the male lead.\n\nBut what's this...? Unlike the original novel, the male lead passionately confesses his love to Louise, and the heroine, who she believed to be kind, has it in for her...?!\n\nHow did this happen? Wasn't it supposed to all work out if I just avoided the male lead?!",
