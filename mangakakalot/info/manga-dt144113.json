  "description": "Description :\r\n        The Duke's daughter Farara was abandoned by the Crown Prince and was imprisoned with illness. The dream I had at that time was that my fianc was robbed by a former friend as the president's daughter, Choko. \"Who is Choko?\" \"Am I abandoned my engagement?\" Farara woke up from a nightmare and realized that she was 12 years old the day after she was engaged to the Crown Prince! I'm not sure, but I don't want to live the same life as my dream. Reflecting on her arrogant self, she decides to start over with the aim of a bright and enjoyable future. Happy fantasy to start over, where Farara (another world) and Choko (modern) struggle.",
