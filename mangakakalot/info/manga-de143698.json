  "description": "Description :\r\n        Rosalie, a girl capable of communicating with the dead, is ostracized by society due to her unique ability. She lives in isolation, working as an investigator who gleans critical information from the deceased unearthed in ancient ruins. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she encounters the remains of Hugo, a once-legendary death knight. Through their connection, she inherits his extraordinary powers. This marks the beginning of her journey as \"Bone Princess,\" a figure destined to influence the world.\nThe story blends supernatural mystery with epic fantasy, focusing on themes of acceptance, legacy, and the power of understanding the past.",
