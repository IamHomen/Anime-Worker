  "description": "Description :\r\n        Yae, the daughter of a long-established kimono shop, Sugikeiya, was promised by her parents when she was young to become the fianc\u00e9e of Tsuyoshi, the eldest son of the prestigious Katsuragi family and an excellent military man.  Yae was treated with respect despite the age difference between her and Yae, who kept her young love in his heart.  Yae, who has feelings for Tsuyoshi, is striving to become a woman worthy of him, as her heart swells with expectations that the red thread of her destiny is connected to Tsuyoshi.  However, one night, Yae encounters a fire and is shocked by the burns on her body.  Yae says that since she has become a defective woman, she is no longer qualified to marry her, and that she wants to break off her engagement to Tsuyoshi, but...  True love, whose purity is scattered by her sweetness, and the red thread burnt by the cruel flames is spun again.",
