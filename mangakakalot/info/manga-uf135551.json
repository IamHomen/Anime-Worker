  "description": "Description :\r\n        \"The Dragon Book\" which thoroughly covers all dragon and shows adventurers the way to their dreams. Said book is a best-seller representing \"Sword and Friends & Co.\" but its contents are based on nothing more than the the dubious stories of adventurers that haven't been verified, as a matter of fact it's riddled with mistakes. The head of the editorial department of Sword and Friends & Co. starts planning a complete revision of \"The Dragon Book\". Two of which who were selected are a rookie reporter with a child-like appearance, Izumi, and the beastman bodyguard, Alf. Pursuing the truth about dragons, the compiling journey begins.",
