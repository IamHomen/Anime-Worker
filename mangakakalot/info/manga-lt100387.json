  "description": "Description :\r\n        Massage Research Society's high expected star Chiaki is a normal, quiet high-schooler. She immediately wants to massage the guy with the beautiful back who she sees on her bus, then coincidentally at her school. But he just happens to be the school's number one good looking guy Yousuke, who doesn't want anybody to massage him. When Yousuke and Chiaki make a bet, what will happen to them!? (From Shojo Beat) The star of her high school's Massage Research Society club, Chiaki Togu is otherwise a normal, quiet girl until she falls in love at first sight with a gorgeous back--a back that happens to belong to Yosuke, the hottest guy at her school! Unfortunately, Chiaki's attraction to Yosuke is thwarted by her own insecurity and the scheming of other girls--especially her twin sister Saya! Although Yosuke seems out of Chiaki's league, she would do anything to give him a massage. The two eventually strike up a deal in which she will be allowed to touch his back if she can make him fall in love with her. What Chiaki doesn't know is the real reason Yosuke wants to hang around her: to avenge his younger brother, who was allegedly deceived and dumped by somebody named Chiaki Togu!",
