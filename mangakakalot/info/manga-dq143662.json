  "description": "Description :\r\n        This is a story from once upon a time - but not recently. \nIn an abandoned village at the foot of Mount Mitsukado, there lived gods in human form. Monokai (specters) come to the village carrying goods to sell to the gods, and mysterious shadows lurk in the forest. \nThis is a mysterious tale of everyday life that traces the lives and memories of the gods. Why do the gods take on human form and why do the specters appear one after another?",
