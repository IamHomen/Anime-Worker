  "description": "Description :\r\n        Hitomi is a pokemon ranger; someone who uses wild pokemon to achieve their goals rather than capturing them. While pokemon rangers don't need balls to capture pokemon, they do use a tool called a slider in order to get closer to the wild pokemon. 2 years after her graduation from the ranger academy, she joins a team with a top ranger. This ranger uses a rare type of slider called a Batonnage slider, which is only available to top rangers. Just what kind of skills does this top ranger have, and more importantly, how exactly does the Batonnage slide work?",
