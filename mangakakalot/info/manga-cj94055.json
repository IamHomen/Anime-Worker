  "description": "Description :\r\n        Memory of the Future allows us into the lives of two teachers, Kento and Akira. Kento is what you expect of the typical well-to-do man: he's dating a beautiful woman, plans to get married, and loves his grandparents. Akira is something of an opposite: he's an openly gay man, does not plan to get married, and has one night stands. These two have their lives intersect when they tumble into bed together, only find out later that they are co-workers.Sequel:>Kaze no Yukue( http://mangapark.me/search?q=kaze-no-yukue )",
