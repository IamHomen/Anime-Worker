  "description": "Description :\r\n        In the world of \"Karma,\" where myths and folklore are timeless echoes of truth, ancient tales gradually unveil their secrets. Each story, once considered mere legend, is now revealed as reality, shaping the world that we live in to this day.\nAs the story unfolds, we will see these truths that were veiled from humanity's eyes, revealing how these myths have come into existence and why they were hidden away from the modern day.\nWe follow the narrative through the eyes of Teru and his team, as they delve into the depths of each realm and unravel the mysteries that lie within. From distant lands to mythical beings, every encounter sheds light on the true history of our reality, revealing the path toward understanding our origins.\nCo-creator/Illustrator - @artdawgsama\nCo-Creator/Writer - @vanillabarss\nWriter - @__ willcross",
