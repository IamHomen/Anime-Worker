  "description": "Description :\r\n        One day, suddenly, gates opened around the world, and monsters appeared. Just when humanity faced the threat of extinction, people began to manifest \"abilities\" that could not be scientifically explained. There were \"Espers\" with combat-related abilities and \"Guides\" who calmed the rampages caused by Espers overusing their powers. Thanks to them, humanity escaped the crisis of extinction. The goal of Miku Hayase, a C-class Guide, is to lead a quiet and stable life without drawing attention, living modestly and comfortably. Suddenly, Miku was informed of a shocking test result indicating an \"89% matching rate\" with the strongest S-class Esper, Kento Yashiro, who is one of only two in the country, and her appointment as his personal Guide! After becoming Kento's personal Guide, Miku's life changed drastically. Kento Yashiro, a younger boy who is affectionate towards Miku and is kind and cute. The other S-class Esper in the country, a rational and cold superior, Genki Kunito. The mysterious British gentleman Esper, Jerry. For some reason, these three incredibly handsome Espers began to obsess over Miku... \"This life is so damn awful!\"",
