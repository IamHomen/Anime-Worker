Among them is Haru, the second son of a Western-style pastry shop. Haru is still in love with Hinato, who transferred to his school in the third grade. Now in high school, he continues to harbor these feelings. However, he doesn't want to burden Hinato, who has become distrustful of people due to certain circumstances, so he has kept his feelings hidden.",
