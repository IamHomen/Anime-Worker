  "description": "Description :\r\n        Orochi is a girl not of this world, that much is clear. Among a few other unique qualities of her, she is immortal. We follow her through the monstrosities she witnesses in her ongoing life; the terrors and horrors of this world considered 'supernatural', the real, true meaning of 'vain' and a few mysteries that are, perhaps, inexplicable, to name a few. Though they do not happen to her in particular, she does try to help out of the goodness of her heart. For the better or for the worse, that much is unclear.",
