  "description": "Description :\r\n        Chae-na plays the unpopular Clover in , the guardian of Madeleine Village.\nShe feels weak and lacking as a hero, so she lives inconspicuously and endures being an unpopular member. She finds the spotlight uncomfortable and awkward.\nHowever, there is someone who accidentally sees her kindness and falls in love at first sight! It is Red, Seung-chan, a popular member of the group that protects the neighboring Eunha Village.\n\"I fell in love at first sight. I think I like you!\"\nShe is thrilled by the appearance of Red, whom she admires, but refuses to confess, saying that she doesn't even know what kind of person she is... After hearing the heart-fluttering words that she doesn't know anything about you and wants to get to know you more, she eventually runs away.\n\"There's no way such a wonderful person would like someone like me. There must be some kind of mistake!\"\nA heart-pounding story about an ultra-popular hero and an unpopular magical girl who accepts his confession!",
