  "description": "Description :\r\n        Mel Slopy, an orphan of common birth, had her hair turn white after a childhood fever. While unconscious from the illness, her parents abandoned her due to their crushing debts, leaving her to be taken in by Noma.  \nOne day, Duke Heaven, grief-stricken and mentally unwell after losing his youngest daughter, mistakes Mel for his deceased child, Bleria Charlotte Heaven, because of their similar hair color.  \nTo quell the growing rumors about his father\u2019s instability, Damian Jeremiah Heaven, the duke\u2019s son, visits Mel. He demands that she pretend to be Bleria to protect the family\u2019s reputation.  \nLiving as Bleria, Mel is soon thrust into preparing for an engagement with Gopher Isaac Allnight, the heir of the powerful Allnight Ducal House. But what challenges await her in this life of deception?",
