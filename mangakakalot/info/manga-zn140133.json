  "description": "Description :\r\n        Black-haired bas**** .\" \nWhy, why, does the male protagonist of romance novels always go to black-haired men? And why, why, do I always end up giving my heart to brown-haired men? The sub-male protagonist of Alliance Marriage', Baileon Biers. The childhood friend of the female protagonist, Princess Odette, and the current prime minister of the empire. Reader 1, who always gives her heart to brown-haired men, fell for his pine-like taste. How can a civil servant defeat the iron-blooded black-haired Northern Grand Duke!! Reader 1, who cried every night, is possessed by Marien Didier, the third aide of the prime minister of Alliance Marriage'. Yes! I will make my beloved love come true with my own hands! I will make Baileon the male protagonist of Alliance Marriage'! \"Aren't you thinking about dyeing your hair? What do you think, black-haired man?\" \"Why do you suddenly have to dye my hair black?\" \"Because it's the only way to end Lord Biers' long-standing unrequited love.\" If hair color is the problem, just dye it! If force is the problem, just practice! Namely, 'Operation to Act Like a Northerner'. Ha. Ji. Man. \"Leaving without looking back, speaking coldly but keeping your body close... What is all this?\" \"This is the way to get through to Her Highness the Fourth Princess.\" \"Does Her Highness really like this kind of behavior?\" \"I'm sure.\" \"This person seems too violent.\" Bayleon, half in doubt but still following Didi's wishes. However, Odette is unwavering, Bayleon smiles bitterly, and the Northern Grand Duke appears. Marien Didi's original favorite, who looks like a fluffy cotton candy rabbit on the outside but is a beast on the inside, is pushing it. Will it succeed?",
