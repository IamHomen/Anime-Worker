  "description": "Description :\r\n        \"You must always be careful with band members because they're known to eat up their fans, okay!\"\n\nUnohara Riri is a big fan of \"Moment Lily\", an indie band that mostly performs in small live venues. For 6 years, she has only been sending letters with her impression of their CDs through the band's staff but now that she's a university student, she's finally found the courage to attend their live show.\n\nWhen she finally did, she got so excited from her first time experiencing the heat of watching the \"real\" Moment Lily in action that she was cutting it close to her last train. While she was in a panic to leave the venue, a drunk started to give her a hard time. That's when she was rescued by none other than Moment Lily's vocalist, AZ (Azu)!!\n\nThis is the pure love story of a timid university student and the vocalist of her favourite band.",
