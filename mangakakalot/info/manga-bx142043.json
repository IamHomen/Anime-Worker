  "description": "Description :\r\n        Suzu Akio, 32 years-old. He dislikes dealing with people but likes smoking, drinking and cats. In a town with a mountain that rains ashes on it, Suzu's days stay the same and time passes by without him ever being concerned about trying to change it. \n\nOne day, when he went to deliver goods to a regular customer, a person who will throw his life into disarray appeared and he is Yutaka, the couple's nephew who has come from Tokyo and the latter attempts to break through the wall that Suzu has put up in his rejection towards human connections.\n\nHere's a warm yet heartrending and somewhat bittersweet story of platonic love between two awkward men.",
