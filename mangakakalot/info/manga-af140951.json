  "description": "Description :\r\n        Kail Black is a soldier sent to an Antarctic research base to study supernatural phenomena. One day, he wakes up to find the base has been attacked by a strange creature, leaving only him and a man named Revo left. More unsettling than his loss of memory is the fact that every night, Kail dreams of having wild, animalistic s** with Revo. \"We're going to have our baby here.\" #Non-human/SupernaturalBeing #MorallyAmbiguous #TsundereUke",
