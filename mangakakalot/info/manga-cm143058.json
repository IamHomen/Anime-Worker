  "description": "Description :\r\n        As magic, once monopolized by the nobility, became accessible to the masses, crime rates surged. In response, the Empire established the Magical Crimes Investigation Bureau. Rogue, a detective, is reassigned to the notorious \"Sixth Division\" due to the schemes of his superior, Veradonna. This division works alongside witches, who once brought disaster to the Empire, to investigate magical incidents. These witches, powerful enough to bring calamity, are imprisoned and have their magic restricted by \"collars.\" However, the witches, led by the \"Puppet Demon\" Miseria, pay no mind to these restraints and constantly throw Rogue into chaos. \"What will you do, Rogue? Shall we consider taking extreme measures?\"",
