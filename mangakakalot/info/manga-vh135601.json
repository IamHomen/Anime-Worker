On the ground where, of course, the people lived was Ningenkai. In the novel adaptation by Ryu Fujisaki, Houshin Engi follows Taikoubou on his mission to rid the Ningenkai of the evil immortals that have resided there. This colorful historically set manga keeps the reader on their feet and loving every minute of the in-depth characters and exciting adventures.",
