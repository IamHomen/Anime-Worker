  "description": "Description :\r\n        Collection of shoujo-ai oneshots found in Yuri Hime and Yuri Shimai.\r\n\r\n1. Akai Kasa, Shiroi Kasa (Red Umbrella, White Umbrella) -\r\nAbout two friends and their ideas about femininity.\r\n\r\n2. Nuigurumi no Harawata (Stuff Animals' Insides)\r\n\r\n3. Michikusa (Weeds on the Wayside) -\r\nAbout a girl who's pretending she likes girls.\r\n\r\n4. Tiger Lily -\r\nAn old woman remembers the past. A helpful bit of information: the two main characters are drawn as their younger selves even in the scenes that take place in the present.\r\n\r\n5. Short Cut -\r\nIf imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the main character of Takahashi Mako's \"Short Cut\" is certainly being paid a great compliment... unfortunately, she doesn't see it that way.\r\n\r\n6. Koorizatou no Kakera\r\n\r\n7. Natsu no Mayu -\r\nAbout a girl who admires her friend. Also deals with coming-of-age issues a bit.\r\n\r\n8. Sandals -\r\nAbout a girl who has a crush on her best friend.\r\n\r\n9. Kanojo no Tonari (Next to Her)\r\n\r\n10. Otome Cake (Maidens' Cake)",
