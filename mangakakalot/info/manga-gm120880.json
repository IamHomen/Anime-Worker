It was originally created by Koike Kazuo, one of the gods of modern manga, and is brought to life through the bewitching battle-art-style of Momojiri Saburou! Just before the chaos of the Warring States Period began, after the Muromachi Period, a young Hojo Soun, who has taken the name Ise Shinkuro, begins a journey to enter into the service of a samurai family. All he has to lead him is his confidence in his spear skills and his passion. Along the way, he finds a poor-looking child sitting in the shadow of a tree, and offers him water and food. This act ends up turning his entire world upside down....",
