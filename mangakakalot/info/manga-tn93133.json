  "description": "Description :\r\n        While testing his 8 mm camera at night in his small town, Kaito Kirishima is caught in a mysterious explosion. Strangely, Kaito wakes up the next day perfectly fine, but with no recollection of what exactly happened the day before. Unfazed by what seems to have been just a dream, he heads to school not giving much thought to the incident. Discussing his camera with his friends, they decide to make a movie during summer break. They invite two upperclassmen to participate in the project: the recently arrived Ichika Takatsuki and the odd Remon Yamano. In a strange twist of fate, Ichika starts living with Kaito because his sister has to work overseas. Summer days are about to get exciting for the small film crew.",
