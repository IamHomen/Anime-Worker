  "description": "Description :\r\n        From Viz:\r\nMomoko is a \"Lolita\" stranded in the boondocks of rural Ibaraki prefecture, although she'd much rather be living in the Palace of Versailles. Ichigo is an impulsive member of a girls-only biker gang who firmly believes in honor, loyalty, and fist fighting. Together this unlikeliest of duos strikes out on a journey to find a legendary embroiderer who might just be able to make their dreams come true.\r\n\r\nAlso in this series are two original stories by Yukio Kanesada, Koyubi-hime and its sequel, Nakayubi-hime.\r\n\r\nRirika is a typical high school student except for the fact that she hates being treated like a child. In order to become a women, she is determined to fall in love with an older, more mature man. One day she meets a handsome business man by the name of Kashiwagi in her mother's jewelry store. Ririka is attracted by his calm and refined demeanor, but he appears to have a ring on his left ring finger...\r\n\r\nBased on a 2002 light novel by TAKEMOTO Novala, which was also adapted into a live action movie in 2004.",
