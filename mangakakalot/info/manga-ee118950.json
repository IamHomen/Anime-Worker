  "description": "Description :\r\n        Naive comic artist Seonho, who draws R-19 series, hires beauty(?)-and-brains Muyoung with outstanding skills to be his assistant. However, working with Muyoung who is too task-oriented and has a prickly temperament, turns out to be a little difficult. Seonho asks Muyoung to pose for him one day to help with a sexy scene, but when he sees how erotic Muyoung's pose is, Seonho's \"junior\"... that hasn't stood in 2 years, got up. It's hard! It got hard! It finally got hard!\n\nThis is an unpredictable, comical and chest-tickling BL story brought to you by Milla and Yalgae!\n(Lonely Soul Translations)",
