  "description": "Description :\r\n        Julis Anderburg, a boy who cannot use magic in a world where magic is omipresent, is the son of a remote lord and has no magical talent, but he lives a life that he cannot be ashamed as a nobleman. Still, for a boy who can't use magic, this world is stuffy. So he thought:  \"Even if you can't use magic, you should be able to use something else, right?\" And so Julis tries to use the magical power in the air to interfere with the world, unlike the magic that uses the magical power in the body to interfere with the world. And he succeeded, in devising this new mana utilization! After that, he helps Cecilia, a girl who is called \"Saintess\" by chance. Julis had a good life with Cecilia, but one day his father asked him to enroll in the \"Magic Academy\" with Cecilia.",
