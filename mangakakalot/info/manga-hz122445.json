  "description": "Description :\r\n        Hakuo Gakuin used to be a prestigious high school and was famous for martial arts. However, because its rival school, Seishikan, has been cowardly luring its superior students, Hakuo is declining.\n\n\nIn order to recover from the situation, the acting principal of Hakuo, Hojo Himeko, sends Yagyu Ranko to Fuma Village in search of the famous Fuma ninja clan for assistance. The leader of Fuma sent Kojiro to Hakuo. There he faces the notorious Yasha clan, who fights for Seishikan, led by Asuka Musashi.\n\n\nSoon Kojiro's comrades arrive and an all-out ninja war postponed for 500 years begins between the two clans.",
