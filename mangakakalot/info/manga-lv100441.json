  "description": "Description :\r\n        Some glasses-wearing student gets caught up in a store robbery and is ruthlessly killed when he tries to subdue the robber...and fails. His departing soul, enticed by the sight of a certain book, is then transferred into a dog's body, which is then picked up at the animal store by a mysterious, scissors-wielding girl. ------------------------------------- From MangaHelpers: There's nothing in the world more enjoyable than reading for Harumi Kazuhito. He spends his days with his head buried in books. But one night when he was enjoying a good story in a caf\u00e9, a violent robber comes in and threatens the people inside. Kazuhito is not the hero type but something came over him and he tried to subdue the robber only to get killed. When he came to, he was reborn as a dog under the care of one of the customers who was in the caf\u00e9 that night, Natsuno Kirihime. Through some kind of connection, Kirihime can hear Kazuhito\u2019s thoughts as a dog. Unfortunately for Kazuhito, Kirihime has a bit of a sadistic personality and a thing for scissors. [vyc]",
