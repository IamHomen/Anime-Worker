  "description": "Description :\r\n        In the mid 21st century, the human race is facing a test. Genetic engineering has changed the world, and with huge profits, research had accelerated accordingly. An \u201cimmortality\u201d gene no longer seemed like a mere dream. However, a lab sample containing this gene escaped, creating a new life-form that took in genetic material from the natural world, evolving into an enemy that began to invade the human world. The \u201cShaher\u201d are now a force capable of defeating human military forces, and both North and South American continents have fallen under their control. In Japan, the government has created a \u201cSamurai\u201d unit to oppose the Shaher, utilizing soldiers enhanced with nano-machines to connect with an armored exoskeleton. It is at this point that Tsukahara Takemichi, an all-around ordinary boy with no millitary background, is assigned to the first platoon of the \u201cSamurai Force,\" a squadron filled with elite recruits. So why is someone so normal amongst them?",
