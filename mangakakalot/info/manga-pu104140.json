  "description": "Description :\r\n        Hina, otherwise known as Guardian Hearts, is sent to Earth on a mission to protect the peace... and with strict orders not to let anyone find out her identity. So when Kazuya accidentally sees Hina transform just when she comes to Earth, he is forced to take her home with him. Because it\u2019s ok to know about a secret identity if you\u2019re family, right? At least that\u2019s what Hina believes! But as if living with Guardian Hearts isn\u2019t troublesome enough, magic girls now seem to be appearing everywhere and revealing themselves to Kazuya! Can Kazuya survive the attentions \u2013 and jealousies \u2013 of so many girls? One thing is for sure, Kazuya\u2019s days will be anything but dull!",
