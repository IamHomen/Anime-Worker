  "description": "Description :\r\n        \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d\nWhen Raphia met her demise after having been used and thrown away by her benefactor, Yuri, she went back nine years in the past.\n\u2018I\u2019m not going to relive that hell!\u2019\nRunning away from her benefactor, she went to Kasein Soleia, Yuri\u2019s archnemesis, and signed a new sponsorship contract with him.\n\u201cI shall kill every single person you despise, Milord.\u201d\n\u201cThe necessary role happens to be open, and you might just be the right person for it.\u201d\nYoung Duke. This is a sponsorship contract, right? But why . . . why are we getting married?\n===\n\u201cThroughout the time I won\u2019t be by your side . . . I will think of nothing but your small, cute head.\u201d\nThat low voice sent shivers down her spine.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving. I\u2019ll just . . .\u201d\nKasein looked at her sharply as if he was daring her to continue making up excuses.\n\u201cYou have to answer well, brat. Depending on what you say, all the wagon and shoe craftsmen of the Empire might lose their livelihood.\u201d\nDespite his harsh words, Kasein\u2019s touch was gentle. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of Raphia, who strangely grew more beautiful by the day.\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** (https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EB%8F%84%EB%A7%9D%EC%B3%A4%EB%8D%94%EB%8B%88-%EA%B2%B0%ED%98%BC%EC%9D%84-%ED%95%98%EA%B2%8C-%EB%90%90%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/3299), (https://page.kakao.com/content/61190666)",
