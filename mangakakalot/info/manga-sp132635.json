  "description": "Description :\r\n        Airheaded, but serious, and with zero leeway! \"I want to be a great teacher!\" says the new grade-school teacher, Maru Hana, while fruitlessly spinning her wheels in days full of disappointing mistakes. Her innocence and clumsiness, akin to a child suddenly growing up, heals those around her. This is a 4 koma comedy about a teacher that sometimes gets pushed around, but slowly but surely comes into her own!",
