  "description": "Description :\r\n        Read manhwa The Reincarnated Witch Finds Her Beloved Prince and Lives Happily Ever After / Shijou Saiaku no Tensei Majo wa Saiai no Ouji to Koi Oshitai /  /  / TENSEI MAJO WA UNMEI NO OUJI O MITSUKEDASHI SHIAWASE NI NARIMASUBefore me stand five handsome princes. All of them are candidates for my hand in marriage. Prince Louis, who looks just like that person; Prince Pierre, who sounds just like that person; Prince Kurt, who is adored by animals, just like that person was; Prince Frederick, who is skilled in swordsmanship, just as that person was; and Prince Dietlint, who does not share any resemblance with that person in the slightest. As a reincarnated witch, I must choose from these five princes and find my beloved prince from my past life. At first glance, I couldn't tell which one was my beloved prince, but I had plenty of time to spare. There was no way I could mistake the prince I loved in my past life. I will surely recognize him. However, each of the five princes exuded their own charms, and they were just as kind to me as they had been in my previous life. With their relentless advances, I fear that I may not be able to tell which one is my beloved prince anymore! Who on earth is my beloved prince?! It wasn't supposed to turn out like this!\"",
