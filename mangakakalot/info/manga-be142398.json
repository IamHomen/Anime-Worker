  "description": "Description :\r\n        Golden Warrior Iczer-One (Part One) takes place 10 years before the Fight! Iczer-1 anime. It's the story of how Iczer-One is awakened and escapes the Cthulhu spaceship just before it is taken over by Big Gold. Iczer-One crashes down on the planet Ishua with no memories and no knowledge about herself or her past. There, she is forced to fight against Magenta, one of the Cthulhu's commanders who is in charge of the Cthulhu's invasion force on this world. \"Part two\" was never writen.\nNot to be confused with (https://mangadex.org/title/b1a3191a-ac14-484e-af3c-3bbbfed28e98/legend-of-Iczer)",
