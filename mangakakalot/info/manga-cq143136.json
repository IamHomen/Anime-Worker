  "description": "Description :\r\n        For four years, Ji-in has been working as an actor in Korea. While on a photo shoot in Bangkok, a man approaches him, and for the first time, Ji-in gives in to his advances. Although the man's expressions linger in Ji-in's mind, he returns to Seoul pretending to be unaffected, as he always has. However, an unexpected reunion with the man shakes his calm exterior.\"I can be pushy sometimes. I'm just pretending to be patient because I don't want you to dislike me.\"As the man's persistence reveals more than his initial suave demeanor, Ji-in finds himself slowly drawn to him. This is a story about men making imperfect choices, seeking change for themselves and their loved ones, and discovering the best decisions amidst life's many options.Original NovelOriginal Webtoon+",
