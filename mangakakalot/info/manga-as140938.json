He starts growing a new character.[Party / CuteJirong: Ah, Mr. Crong, please heal...][Party / ParkMinyeo: Mr. Crong, what if you attack the boss from there? You should have saved the tank.][Party / CuteJirong: The healer should stay back and heal. Why do you keep attacking mobs from the front?]...I've only tried PVP, so I don't know how to heal.Will he be able to recruit Scania and exact revenge after all?+",
