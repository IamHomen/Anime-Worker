One day, he goes to a hotel designated by his client for a meeting only to find that the bride isn't there and that he is left alone with the groom, Izumi, who exudes a gloomy aura.\"Isn't it beautiful? I picked it out because I thought it'd suit you, you know... Ikuyama-san?\"In the midst of the meeting, he is suddenly overthrown by a feeling of drowsiness and when he wakes up... for some reason, he's been put in a snow-white dress?!",
