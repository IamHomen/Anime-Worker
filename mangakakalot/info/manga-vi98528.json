With the help of her friend Akira, she investigates him, until the trail leads her to an abandoned-looking house where a strange and scary foreigner lives. He and Kouichi seem to have some kind of relationship, but what is it? Kana's and Akira's take on that question are completely different and there's still a chance both of them are wrong!",
