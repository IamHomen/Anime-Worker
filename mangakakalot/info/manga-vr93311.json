  "description": "Description :\r\n        From acme: Dame BL is \"a collection of BL oneshots written by some of the lesser-known participants in the genre (and some you may be familiar with already), with a focus on less conventional settings and characters. We're very far away from high school here, which hopefully you'll agree makes a pleasant change of pace.\" 1. Be Here to Love Me (KUMOTA Haruko) The relationship of a foot-fetishist and his cunning colleague. 2. Kou no Kawa (MOROZUMI Sumitomo) Set in ancient times, a village is near starvation due to a bad harvest. For some reason, the young chief takes care of a cursed man he finds lying in the river... 3. Khaa Thoong (Est Em) Can the young Thai kick-boxer rekindle the thirst for competion in a senior boxer after his devastating defeat? Column 1 (AOYAMA Toomi) Useless Side Characters Column 2 (Kashima) Obsession/Favoritism Column 3 (KUSAMA Sakae) Terror! Kappa Lake 4. Natsu no Saigo ni Yosete (UMEMATSU Machie) Two elderly men reminisce about their lives together over a bowl of peaches. 5. Locas! (OKADAYA Tetuzoh) Jean-Luc fell in love through correspondence in a chat with Al. What will occur, when he will decide to meet off-line? Is it really Al that wrote to him in chat? 6. And Robo (CHIBA Ryouko) A touching tale of robot clones... or something. 7. Shinumade BL Shindemo BL (Takeuchi Sachiko) 8. Tonari wa Nani wo Suru Hito zo (UNO Jinia) The unusual love a man has for his fan in the hot summer. 9. Soldier (Zin) A nazi sadist and a prisoner in camp. Excitement, desire, but... what about love? Attachment? Column 4 (KEVIN Komine) Column 5 (COTORINO Deathco) Eronashi BL Column 6 (PSYCHE Delico) Column 7 (YONEDA Kou) 10. Muhou no Shounen (Mochimeko) A story involving a Reckless Young Man and some scary faced gangsters. 11. Ima Doushiteru (ROTTA Ikumi) The funny relationship between a man who has a fetish for soft/chubby things and his fatty otaku-friend. 12. It Must Be (MOMOYAMA Naoko) A story about two professional cyclists and their travails.",
