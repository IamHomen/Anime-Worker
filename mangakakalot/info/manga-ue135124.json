  "description": "Description :\r\n        A feeling of emptiness that never seems to know fullness. A never ending cycle of despair that resembles the birth of life. It only knows the everlasting torture of life. Never wasting away and always being there to witness it all to the very end. Immortality? Godlike status? No. It\u2019s a much more worse case than that. It\u2019s always being in the start but never feeling the satisfaction of crossing the finish line. It\u2019s having all the power in the world but never knowing when or how to use it. It\u2019s a case we call \u201cYoyokuu Hosts\u201d.",
