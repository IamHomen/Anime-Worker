  "description": "Description :\r\n        The Marronnier Kingdom lies landlocked by seven other nations. General Baribara sends her seven children, from the sleepless Nemukunai to the eternally hungry Harapeko, out to these kingdoms in the interests of diplomacy.  Yet Baribara herself is not from Marronnier, and questions swirl internally and externally about her power and those of her children; and it seems there may be more going on in the other kingdoms linked to her family than is first apparent.  Winner of \"Kono Manga ga Sugoi!\" in 2018 in the female category (the second year in the row for manga-ka Nao Iwamoto), this josei fantasy series is full of humour, romance, and mystery.",
