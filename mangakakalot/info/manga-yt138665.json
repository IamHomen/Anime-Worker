  "description": "Description :\r\n        \"Wouldn't you like to hear my love song?\"Shiori failed to make friends upon entering school, thus, she spends her time as a loner. The only support for her is the music of her favourite singer \"Kanade,\" and she eagerly awaits the release of his new song. Then, by chance, she finds out that  this \"Kanade\" is actually her classmate, Utsumi! She can't believe she's about to meet her crush in real life, but to her suprise, once they're face to face, Utsumi asks her to be his girlfriend so he can experience love to be able to write a love song. A pure, heart-pounding love story that will make your heart skip a beat!.(Source: Seishun Scans)",
