  "description": "Description :\r\n        The world is plagued by the \"Daemonia\". These creatures will take advantage of people experiencing a high level of negative emotions and transform them into blood thirsty monsters. Only the power of the Elemental Tarot, wield by girls from 22 special bloodlines, can defeat them. Akari Taiyo is 12 year girl who dreams of becoming a fortune teller just like her late mother. She is chosen to carry \"The Sun\" card and joins a mysterious Daemonia fighting organization called \"Sefiro Fiore\". Shortly after joining, Akari learns the horrid truth on how defeating a Daemonia means completely eliminating the person possessed by the creature.",
