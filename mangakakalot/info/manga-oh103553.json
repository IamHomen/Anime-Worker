  "description": "Description :\r\n        Asahina Daigo, a young man fresh out of school and inaugurated into Company \"Me,\" a firefighting unit in an area known for its lack of fires (which gives Company \"Me\" a slacker image). Daigo is not particularly heroic; he's overly competitive against his rivals, naive, myopic, inexperienced, short-tempered, and is often off in la-la land with a spaced-out expression on his face.",
