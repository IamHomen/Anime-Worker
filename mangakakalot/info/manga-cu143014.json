Everything was fine until I met new person Biyeon. As soon as we met, he started doing such things and even clung to me without hesitation. When asked why they came together like this, they said: \"If you and I had s**\" \"It means I can protect you with my strength, even if he G** doesn't care about you.\" Can I really trust it? Or is the person without a lover actually a mixed ghost?Maybe you like !",
