  "description": "Description :\r\n        The story follows the life of a teenage boy named \"Mesh,\" so-called for his unique \"mesh\"-colored hair: blonde with silver strands on the sides. It begins with a scene where Mesh, after being beaten, escapes from a mob and encounters Milon, a forger and painter. Mesh ends up staying at Milon\u2019s house, and the two form an unlikely bond as they navigate life together. Each chapter is a poetic blend of crime, peaceful everyday moments, or the vibrant nightlife of artists in a fictionalized Paris.\n\"Mesh\" is regarded as one of Hagio Moto\u2019s defining works, marking a pivotal shift in her artistic style. It was her first series to adopt a more realistic look while retaining the ethereal beauty characteristic of 1970s sh\u014djo art. The story ventures into more mature themes while continuing to explore Hagio's recurring motifs, such as parent-child relationships and adolescence.",
