  "description": "Description :\r\n        During a rare total lunar eclipse, as the blood-red moon showed up in the sky, countless black particles erupted from its surface and rained down on Earth. Anyone struck by these particles transformed into monstrous, black creatures. Like ravenous zombies, they attacked the living, spreading the horrifying transformation like wildfire. Caught in the chaos, a college student named Xu Baijin bands together with a group of survivors, fighting for their lives against the relentless onslaught of monsters. As they struggle to survive, they begin to uncover a chilling truth: this apocalyptic event is no mere natural disaster, but a dark secret lurks beneath the surface, waiting to be revealed!",
