  "description": "Description :\r\n        In 1992, Shintaro Kago began publishing what was supposed to be the first full-length manga of his career. Unfortunately, the magazine that published it, Bandai's Cyber Comix, was discontinued in October of that year and the manga remains unfinished to this day. Only three chapters exist. Kago did recycle the basic concept of a girl able to switch between our reality and a cyberspace-like spiritual realm in a later one-shot (ataraxia) and an even later different full-length work (Six Consciousnesses Thought Changing Ataraxia).",
