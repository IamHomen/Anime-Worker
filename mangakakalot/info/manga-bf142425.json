  "description": "Description :\r\n        In a desolate dystopia, Idols weave a story of love and bonding. In a world devastated by the sudden arrival of a meteorite, countries use Idols as a means of war, plundering resources and territories based on the quality of their performances. In this context, in one of the nations, the \"Land of Sand\", Idol \"Rain\" reigns supreme, being feared by other Idols as a \"Disaster\". Although she is the strongest, she lacks emotions, until she meets \"Hana\", a girl who longs to be the real \"Idol\" who used to bring smiles to people. Together, they embark on a new destiny.",
