  "description": "Description :\r\n        From ADV: Ray was bred and raised to be a living, breathing organ donor. After her own eyes were taken from her, a stranger bestows upon her the gift of sight and something extra - she has X-Ray vision! Ten years later, Ray works as a nurse and moonlights as an underground medical doctor performing for-profit, off-the-book medical procedures. But her daily routine is interrupted by a chance encounter with an old friend that triggers Ray's memories of her hellish childhood. Ray will begin a search that will lead her back to the people who stole her eyes-and her childhood!",
