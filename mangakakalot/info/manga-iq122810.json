The friend of the stalker villainess, who gets her executed. The pushover who followed her friend that brought her doom, also known as extra 1. \u2026Why do I remember an extra who\u2019s of no importance? Damn it, I became that Ludia! I made up my mind that I won\u2019t die miserably and live on but\u2026 Hello, crown prince. Why are you straying away from the female lead, and keep getting entangled with me?
