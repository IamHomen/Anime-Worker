  "description": "Description :\r\n        Long straight hair drenched by the rain, a white dress, his first love. He had fainted due to that vague combination. It wasn't because she was someone he'd been wanting to see, but because he thought the woman who was standing in the rain was a ghost. He ended up going back to that same place. Maybe it was because he missed those eyes that couldn't hide the subtle heat, yet simultaneously they weren't asking for anything.  The woman who dominated his memories now began to erode all of him.",
