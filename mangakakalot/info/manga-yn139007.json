  "description": "Description :\r\n        Heian-era Kyoto. Rumours swirl of the beautiful Kaguya-hime, who sets her suitors impossible tasks to complete but is a favourite of the young Emperor. The Emperor's bodyguards, the Takiguchi, have been decimated by a massacre known as \"The Fifteen Nights of Blood\", of which there was only one survivor; the mysterious Tsukuyomi, who intervenes in a fight between the Takiguchi and the Hokumen, the forces of the ex-emperor Giten-no-Kimi.  Tsukuyomi is the only known survivor of the Fifteen Nights of Blood, and searches for vengeance for their brother's murder.  Yet Tsukuyomi is not what they seem in many ways - and when they meet Princess Kaguya, it becomes clear that there is far more than meets the eye to the intrigues of the Imperial Court.",
