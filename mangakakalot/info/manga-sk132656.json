  "description": "Description :\r\n        I possessed a supporting character in a reverse harem novel.A young concubine who, in the end, was driven to death for treason after begging for attention from the Emperor who was the female lead, and doing wicked things to the male leads who were the Concubines.Despite everything, the fortunate thing was that I possessed her right after entering the Imperial Palace.Even if everyone in the Imperial Palace were wary of me, they didn\u2019t hate me yet.\u2018Let\u2019s not be impudent, and be obedient.\u2019I obstinately didn\u2019t need nor have the mindset of trying to be loved by the Emperor.Although the male leads who were the Concubines were giving me glances, I could just lie flat.Since it wasn\u2019t even a very difficult thing, I really did so.It was definitely like that, but\u2013\u201cCome to my bedchamber tonight. I\u2019ll read you a fairy tale book!\u201d\u201cP-Please don\u2019t cry. I\u2019ll give you this.\u201dJust why is everyone\u2019s attitude endlessly gentle?I couldn\u2019t understand. And it was baffling.\u2018\u2026I don\u2019t need it though?\u2019I wasn\u2019t really a young kid lacking affection. And that gaze in which they looked at me as if I was the loveliest in the world was extremely uncomfortable.Just where would I use a fairy tale book that\u2019s full of jewels and silk, and the magic pearl which is the Imperial Family\u2019s heirloom?Since it\u2019s already been done, I just wish for everyone to get out of my palace.",
