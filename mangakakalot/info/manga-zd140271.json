  "description": "Description :\r\n        Kazuki Natsume's latest work! \nMinato, the workaholic president of a company, has nurtured it into a big one. \nOne night, he was unexpectedly told \"I like you\" by his 9 years younger private driver, Maibara.\n\u2013 I want to see him. I want to hear his voice. I want to tell him to look at me. Before I knew it, even more so than at work, my head was filled with Maibara?!\nHe doesn\u2019t know the shameful side of him yet. It's clumsy, but he falls in love in an honest way. A soft salaryman romance! \n*A revised part of \"The Man Who Waits\" (single issue) (1) has been added to the currently electronically available edition of the work \"BL Anthology: The One I Fell In Love With Was A Man\".",
