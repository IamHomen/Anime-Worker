  "description": "Description :\r\n        Cheong Gyeong, a university student who was stranded on snow-covered Baekdu Mountain in the middle of winter, was rescued by the mountain\u2019s protector - a white tiger named Baek Beom. After wandering into the divine realm, Baek Beom would have to rid Cheong Gyeong of these memories and send him on his way; but for some reason, he did not want to let him go. They spent a season together, but humans cannot be allowed to leave with memories of this world, so Cheong Gyeong\u2019s memories were erased, and he was sent on his way. After this, Baek Beom grew sick, longing for Cheong Gyeong, so he made a deal with God. He would be allowed to go down to the realm of humans and bring Cheong Gyeong back within 100 days. Now, keep your eyes open wide; a tiger has descended from Baekdu Mountain.",
