  "description": "Description :\r\n        Ever thought, what if jjk characters were swapped with completely unrelated ones? if the answer\u2019s yes, then I guess my 'manga' is worth checking out.For now, I'm adapting part of the gojo vs sukuna fight, but with monika and sayori as the characters.In the lore of JJLC , this fight happens after monika deleted the other 3 girls, but due to a 'bug' ,sayori managed to avoid it. Since monika's power doesn't work on sayori for some reason, they'll have to fight.",
