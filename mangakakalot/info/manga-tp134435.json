  "description": "Description :\r\n        I was the villainess who would die at the hands of the male lead, but I know this is a clich\u00e9!

If I was going to die anyway according to the original, then let\u2019s give a kiss to my handsome husband!\u2026 Why did the original plot start to change?",
