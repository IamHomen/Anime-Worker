  "description": "Description :\r\n        The man whom she used to be so passionately in love with so many years ago suddenly disappears, only to appear right before her eyes once more. What should Lin Shan Shan do? Interrogate him? Ignore him? Pretend that nothing ever happened?\nUnfortunately, Lin Shan Shan is unable to do any of those. Despite it all, she could never erase the man before her from her heart. Yet, when he had reappeared in front of her once again, he's already the father of a daughter. All of those times where she had imagined their reunion have all suddenly turned into a sour joke that she keeps locked within her heart.",
