A newly established performing arts class at Kissho Academy High School, created for students who work in various media industries! Onizuka, who says he has no regrets whatsoever, quietly begins to tell the truth of the incident in prison. \nAt last the decades-spanning story of Eikichi Onizuka comes to a dramatic conclusion!\n*This is the continuation of the GTO: Paradise Lost story under a new name as the author changed publishers. The content is the same as the Young Magazine serialization \"GTO Paradise Lost\" up until episode 99, but there will be additions and corrections from that point on.",
