  "description": "Description :\r\n        Nagisa Misumi and Honoka Yukishiro couldn't be more different. Nagisa is sporty and Honoka bookish, and while they attend the same school, they have very little in common - until one day, a shower of shooting stars brings two very unlikely visitors into their lives: Mippuru and Meppuru, refugees from the Garden of Light, which has been conquered by Darkness. Endowed with new and startling powers, Nagisa and Honoka become Cure Black and Cure White, magical defenders of the light --- together, they are Pretty Cure. There are two versions of the story: the tankobon one, which follows the anime and contains four extra chapters from the sequel \"Pretty Cure Max Heart\", and the Nakayoshi one, which consists of 11 chapters about the everyday life of the main characters. The two versions were printed in 2014 as a two-volume series under the \"Wide KC\" label.",
