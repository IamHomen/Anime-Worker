  "description": "Description :\r\n        I reincarnated as the wife of a cursed archduke in my own twisted novel. As the author, I took responsibility and set things right by lifting the curse, which was the key to returning home. I thought my job was done, and just when I was finally trying to go back, the archduke asked me, \"Did you really think I wouldn't know that you\u2019re planning on returning to your fiance?\"He had completely misunderstood!\"Whether you like it or not, I'm still your husband. I'm never letting you go back to that bastard.\"All I want is for him to please let me go home!",
