Within two years of her marriage, Yu Lingxi passed away suddenly. After her death, Ning Yin did not set up a mourning hall nor attend her funeral, buried her, and even became more crazy, slaughtering the whole city. After she is reborn, she is still the noble daughter of the General's palace. Yu Lingxi and her guards try to find Ning Yin who was living on the streets, intending to avenge her former lover. However, when she arrives at the scene, she sees the thin boy being pressed to the ground and about to have his left leg broken.",
