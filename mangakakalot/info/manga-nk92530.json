  "description": "Description :\r\n        When Mikoto was little, she first heard the voices of plants. She also gained flower markings on her face and body, as a sign of her connection to them. Unfortunately for her, she was brutally teased and bullied, both for the markings and her claims that she could hear flowers talking. By the time she was in high school, Mikoto took to wearing clothes specifically designed to cover everything, but she still couldn't escape her classmates' bullying.\r\n\r\nOne day, a strange and exuberant transfer student, Aozakura Yuji, appears and takes an interest in Mikoto. He's determined to start a flower arrangement club, but with a twist: he wants to photograph beautiful girls arranged with flowers. He first pursues Mikoto, both for her beauty and because he bears the same flower markings as she does. After he photographs her for a promotional poster, everyone at school can see the beauty of Mikoto and her flower markings. Will Aozakura's flower arrangement club succeed? Is this the start of a new high school life for Mikoto?",
