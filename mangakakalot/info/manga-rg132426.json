A certain night, Trevor realises that he lost important documents pertaining a client and doesn't seem to be able to find them anywhere. As he's ready to accept defeat and the end of his career, his salvation comes in the form of Gene, a young man who works as a cleaner on the same bulding as Trevor's lawyer firm, and who saw him drop his documents on his way out. After he hands them back to him and Trevor learns that the young man is homeless, Trevor invites him to stay over at his house as to escape the cold winter night. But is that enough to thank his saviour?",
