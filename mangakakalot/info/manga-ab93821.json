  "description": "Description :\r\n        The show starts by introducing youth buddies with quite a powerful and close camaraderie Syaoran, a young archaeologist who's investigating a ruin inside Sakura, and the Kingdom of Clow, princess of the Kingdom of Clow and daughter of the late king Clow Reed. When Sakura and Syaoran in the ruins visit, her spirit assumes the type of a set of wings that are ghostly that disintegrate to other measurements. Syaoran satisfies the Dimensional Witch, Yuko Ichihara, to whom he begs for aid to conserve Sakura as she descends into a catatonic near-death state. Yuko can be seen by two the others who each have their particular wish: Kurogane, a ninja who wants to go back to his house world after being banished from his world by Princess Tomoyo to enable him to understand what true power is; and Fai D. Flowright, a wizard who wants to never return to his house world, Celes, to prevent his king, Ashura-?. In trade for the power to go across measurements, Yuko needs that each spend with that they value most: his sword Ginry is offered by Kurogane?; Fai and Syaoran offer the tat that suppresses his tremendous magic strength and energy and all of Sakura's recollections that call for him, respectively. Yuko then provides an animal named Mokona Modoki that sends the team on a journey across measurements in search of Sakura's feathers to them. After getting the primary feathers, Sakura begins regaining her memories and awakens from her catatonic state. During their experiences, the group slowly grows nearer to to the level that they are jokingly labeled by Fai as relatives. As they journey, they discover the feathers will bestow several unnatural powers to those that possess them and have their own unique capabilities.\n\nThroughout their trip in Tokyo, the team finds that Syaoran is in truth a clone imbued with half the heart of the first Syaoran. Many years back, Fei- produced the clone to gather Sakura's feathers and the magician who caused her recollections to be lost by Sakura, Wang Reed, took the first Syaoran prisoner. Soon following the first Syaoran breaks of Fei-Wang the maintain of, his heart is lost by the clone and becomes an puppet that follows Fei Wang's will, betraying the team. The first Syaoran joins with Sakura wanting to save the clone in the team trip. Foreseeing another in which Fai kills the first Syaoran driven by Fei-Wang the hex of, Sakura gets stabbed in his area, but in once divides soul and her body, delivering each to Seresu distinct worlds as well as the Dream World, respectively. In the Dream World, Sakura's soul is destroied by the Syaoran clone when attempting get the feathers. Before her soul perishes, Sakura shows that she is a clone of the first Sakura who had been also taken prisoner by Fei Wang. Fei Wang subsequently requires Sakura's body to utilize its energy that is stored. The team departs to save the two Sakuras understanding from Yuko that Fei Wang is within an alternative measurement in the Kingdom of Clow. Such measurement that is parallel is the effect of Syaoran's desire to conserve the first Sakura from Fei Wang's bane years back. In order to allow his want, Syaoran became Fei Wang's prisoner and Kimihiro Watanuki, Yuko's helper, was used to replace Syaoran within the background in his first world.\n\nThe team combat Fei Wang who ruins the Syaoran clone when he betrays him. Then he uses power of the two Sakuras and the immeasurably powerful power to resurrect Yuko, accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed her departure to prevent, therein establishing himself Clow's not inferior. Yuko utilizes Clow's magic as payment and her existence to help make the clones reborn before to dwell together. As the 2 understand all the string' events would recur, themselves are sealed by the clones before the conflict against him in the store of Yuko. The team manages to destroy Fei Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between area and time, pulling along both Watanuki and his clone as a result of the link. Using their originator's departure, both clones of Syaoran and Sakura disappear leaving two feathers. Watanuki and Syaoran escape in the emptiness to get a cost: Syaoran should carry on while Watanuki should remain in the store of Yuko, going through the measurements eternally. Where Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona choose to join Syaoran once again in expectation of getting a means to restore the clones who remain as the two feathers the team rests in the Kingdom of Clow. Before departing on their different ways, Sakura and Syaoran admit their near, mutually powerful and pure intimate love for every other as they expect to fulfill again.",
