  "description": "Description :\r\n        A fighting manga set in China. Ramenman, the main character, travels from place to place, fighting various enemies. Originally debuting in Yudetamago's other early work, Kinnikuman, Ramenman became so popular (more so than Kinnikuman himself), that he got his own spinoff. It was serialized from June of 1982 to December of 1988 in Fresh Jump (officially ending in the January 23, 1989 issue, due to the suspension of the magazine itself). It was made into an animated series in 1988.  \n\nSince the Ramenman in this series seems to have no direct connection to Kinnikuman's Ramenman, it is assumed that this series is set in a parallel world. There is also the belief that this Ramenman is supposed to be the ancestor of Kinnikuman's Ramenman.",
