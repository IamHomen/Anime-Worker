  "description": "Description :\r\n        \u201cNoah, open your eyes! This can\u2019t be your last. Please\u2026!\u201d I was summoned to this world just because I was holding a novel, \u201cThe Heart of a Dragon, and I became the second lead character in the novel. And you, the master of the sword and my husband. Our meeting was so fateful. So I didn\u2019t believe your love. Because I thought you loved the heroine, not me. Unlike the novel, I realized only after you died in vain. I\u2019m a coward. I loved you, but I refused it because I was afraid I would lose you. Now\u2026 it\u2019s time to settle the debt owed by the Dragon. The day I came back from the first meeting with you, I decided. I\u2019m not going to let you die this time. \u201cI\u2019ll protect you no matter what. Trust me!\u201d Even if you\u2019re the strongest hero in the world who doesn\u2019t need help.",
