  "description": "Description :\r\n        Shinjuku, 2012. Yamada, who works as a hostess in a night club, meets Mii-chan, a new girl who is no good at anything she does. Mii-chan is energetic and motivated, but she can't read kanji or the atmosphere, so she is ridiculed by those around her and labeled as \"pitiful.\" Nevertheless, Yamada is gradually drawn to Mii-chan as she works diligently.\n(Translated from Magazine Pocket.)\n(Originally serialised on X/Twitter under a pseudonym and released in collected volumes on Kindle. The original manga began with shorts, then ran \"Mii-chan and Yamada-san\" as a lengthier story. This is a reboot with the same basic premise. The author worked in a hostess club when she was in college, but has publicly stated in interviews and on social media that while there was a \"Mii-chan\" who served as the inspiration for the character, everything else about the story is fictional.)",
