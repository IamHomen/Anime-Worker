  "description": "Description :\r\n        Adapted from Light Novel series by Nomura Mizuki. Meet Kanoha Inoue, winner of a prostegious writing award at the age of 14. Mistakenly branded a \"Mysterious Bishoujo Author\" and subsequently vowed to never write publicly again. Meet Amano Tooko, self-proclaimed \"Bungaku Shoujo\". Eats up works of literature, literally. The two of them are the only members of the Literature Club. Each day he writes short stories for her to eat. Until one day Tooko arbitrarily decided to put up a drop box for anyone with a problem... From Baka-Updates: The \"mysterious school comedy\" centers on the unusual members of a high school literary club. Toko Amano, a high school senior who calls herself the \"literary girl\" as the club president, is actually a supernatural creature (yokai) that devours stories \u2014 she tears pages from books to munch on them. Her club subordinate is Konoha Inoue, a second-year high school boy who writes stories every day for Amano to eat. He once wrote an award-winning novel, but he wrote it under the penname Miu Inoue so readers thought the author was a mysterious 14-year-old bishoujo novelist. The stress from the novel's fame and its movie and television drama plans turned Inoue into an introverted recluse.",
