Born into glory, his life has been a lonely one, with his parents forcing him to fulfill his role as the next head of the family. However, everything changes when a new gardener, Jungwon, appears in his life. Unlike other servants who ignore Esther's trauma inflicted by his upbringing, Jungwon cares for and comforts the young master. Esther is instantly drawn to Jungwon's gentle nature and falls in love with him. Ten years later, Jungwon decides to leave and return to his hometown. \"Don't leave,\" Esther says, \"or I'll kill your whole family.\"",
