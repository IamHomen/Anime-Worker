Only the people who enjoy living in this place, a life cut off from the sun, call it by another name: \u201cThe Under Grand Hotel\u201d. Absorbed in pleasure-seeking sex, the shut-call, Erie (leader of the prisoners) isn\u2019t watching the men he\u2019s raping each night, but rather one man alone. Norman. Norman, who keeps trying to harm himself as a result of trauma, the kind doctor who cares for him, Van, and Erie, who\u2019s falling into a brutal love that\u2019s more akin to hatred\u2026 What will happen when these various feelings are made to intertwine into a closed-off world? From storyteller Sadahiro Mika, the long-awaited, mature love story of the \u201cUnder Grand Hotel\u201d begins!",
