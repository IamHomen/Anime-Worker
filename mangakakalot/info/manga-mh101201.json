  "description": "Description :\r\n        Aizen Kanou, just like any high-school boy, yearns for a girlfriend. But he's so painfully shy he flees when any girl tries to talk to him. Except his childhood friend, Yuzu, who scolds him for being so shy. But she leaves behind a temple love-charm. That night in his room Kanou uses the charm to demand heaven grant him his wish for a beautiful girl. When he wakes up in the morning, he finds his wish has been granted--and the beautiful girl is himself.",
