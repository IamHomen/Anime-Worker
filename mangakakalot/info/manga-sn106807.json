  "description": "Description :\r\n        Mobile Suit Gundam 00F is a manga side story that's concurrent in canon with the Mobile Suit Gundam 00 anime. The manga features the Celestial Being group called Fereshte that deploys the second generation Gundams, the GNY series. They are the shadow group of Celestial Being as to the primary Gundam Meister's and crew of the Ptolemaios. Fereshte was proposed by second generation Gundam Meister, Chall Acustica, and approved by Veda to support Celestial Being within their shadows. As Celestial Being begins their anti-war activities, Fereshte begins to move in with the group being led by Chall Acustica, an ex-veteran of Celestial Being who had ended her service as a Gundam Meister after getting scarred in an unknown accident. Under her wing is Fon Spaak, an 18-year old career criminal forced into Fereshte's service by using the GNY-004 Gundam Plutone as part of his \"services\" as a Meister pilot.",
