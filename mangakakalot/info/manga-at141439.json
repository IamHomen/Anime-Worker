  "description": "Description :\r\n        The manga follows the life of 28-year-old manga creator Natsume Kanazawa. Natsume has been a manga creator for five years, but her career has yet to take off. One day her boyfriend tells her he intends to marry her, so he asks her to go to India with him. Even though she doesn't want to quit her job as a manga creator, she takes the chance and goes with him. However, once in India, her boyfriend tells her that she'll be handling all the housework after they're married. Just as Natsume becomes frustrated as to why women have to do housework, she meets a woman from India named Ruby who also is frustrated that it's normal for women to quit work once they get married. Despite cultural differences, the two share the same concerns in life. The manga follows Natsume's travels in India, a country that changes her life.",
