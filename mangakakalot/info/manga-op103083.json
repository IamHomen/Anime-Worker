  "description": "Description :\r\n        In response to signs of an impending invasion by alien conquerors, five young people have undergone modification surgery in order to gain the strength to fight them off when they arrive... ...but there's been no sign of them since the initial warning message ten years ago. So in the meantime, the hero of justice Serena and her teammate/lackey/punching bag Souya have been using their powers to protect the weak and destroy evil wherever it looms its head... ...and when they're not doing that, Serena's trying to pick up chicks. And Souya's fiddling arond with his anime figures. But with the sudden return of their childhood friend, things are in for a change... ...or maybe not.",
