  "description": "Description :\r\n        During Kouta's high school days, when he'd spend his time getting into fights, he had a friend he could trust called Daigo. He thought they'd always be together, but a dark cloud fell over him; once they graduated, Daigo disappeared. Though their parting was sudden, their reunion is as well. Kouta, who had moved on and found a regular job, hears a familiar voice when his boss takes him out drinking. He sees his best friend working as a waitress in a crossdressing bar... What does Kouta find out about Daigo's disappearance after he chases him down...? Do the strongest partners equal the strongest couple!? This is a story about pure, happy love that wavers between friendship and something more!",
