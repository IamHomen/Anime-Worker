However, Hazen has the experience and overwhelming ability as the strongest magician that he cultivated in his previous life. He slaughters his malevolent subordinates in accordance with military law, and completely refutes his superiors who complain. He achieved extraordinary results, such as making peace with a hostile tribe by teaming up with a genius girl, and defeated all the annoying bosses!An exhilarating upstart fantasy about an unscrupulous superior!",
