  "description": "Description :\r\n        Rose, a prideful and spoiled princess, is known for her arrogance and lack of charm, making her widely disliked. After a life-changing event, she decides to turn her life around and make amends for her past behavior. Her first step? Breaking off her engagement with her kind and supportive fianc\u00e9, Rein, to free him from being tied to someone like her.\nHowever, to Rose's surprise, Rein doesn't react as she expects. Instead, he openly declares: \"I can't help but find you irresistibly cute.\" Confused and flustered, Rose struggles to understand his feelings while grappling with her own emotions.\nThis romantic comedy explores themes of personal growth, self-worth, and unexpected love, all wrapped in the quirky charm of a tsundere protagonist.",
