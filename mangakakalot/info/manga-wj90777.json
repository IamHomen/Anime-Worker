  "description": "Description :\r\n        In a jungle in Africa right on the equator there was a white lion, Panja, who was called the \"Emperor of the Jungle.\" But Panja is killed by a hunter. His wife, the Queen of Jungle, who has been caught by the hunter, gives birth to the son of Panja on a ship bringing them to a zoo. She names her son \"Leo\" and has him escape from the ship, saying, \"Go back to Africa and become the successor of your father.\" Then a storm comes and the ship is overturned, and sinks with the Queen on it. Leo is washed up on the beach of a port town in the Arabian Peninsula, not Africa. This is where Leo's long adventure begins.",
