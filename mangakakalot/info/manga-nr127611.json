  "description": "Description :\r\n        Spirits roam the land in the mountainous country of Donghye. Some live peacefully alongside human beings, whereas others prey on the innocent. Solitary swordsman Sehui Han travels the land hunting down spirits and ghosts that plague the lives of ordinary folk. He is aided by a powerful spirit called Black Tiger, who grants Sehui strength in return for being allowed to feed on the spirits they meet. One day, Sehui encounters a young spirit called the Hwimori. Though she appears to be an innocent child, government soldiers are on her trail, determined to track her down. Empathizing with her plight, Sehui embarks upon a journey to restore her name and memories\u2026 but what will they find at the end of their road?----\u00a0 Translation>(https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/spirit-hunter)- (https://manga.line.me/product/periodic?id=Z0001679)- (https://www.webtoons.com/id/action/spirit-hunter/list?title_no=2259)",
