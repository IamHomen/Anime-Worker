  "description": "Description :\r\n        Famous Tsubakiya Jousei, from the Faculty of Law, and popular Sakurai Motoki, from the Faculty of Education, are hot guys who don't know failure when it comes to bringing girls home from mixers. Coming back from a disappointing mixer, Jousei says, \"If it's between those, you give me more of a hard on!\" Drunk and going with the heat of the moment, the two end up at a love hotel?! They only went in with the momentum, but Jousei actually gets hard, so a surprised Motoki has no choice but to jerk him off with his hands. With curiosity and interest, the situation escalates. In the face of pleasure, reason quickly breaks down and realization only hits afterwards? Danger approaches for the ultimate combination of these two mixer legends! Their relationship shifts delicately- Will it take the form of love or friendship?",
