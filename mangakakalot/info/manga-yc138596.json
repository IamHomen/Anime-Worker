The huge, crowded, urban environment is alien to her and she finds it terrifying. During a search for suitable accommodation Kaede meets and befriends a kind, seemingly normal, local estate agent. Little does she know that this man hides a dark and sinister secret. This fateful encounter sets off a sequence of stalking events, which gives Kaede something to be really terrified about.",
