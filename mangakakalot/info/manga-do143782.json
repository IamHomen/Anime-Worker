  "description": "Description :\r\n        A man who is unbothered with work, hobbies, and romance is invited on a motorcycle tour by a woman he work with, and this marks his first step into the extraordinary.\nThough he is hesitant at first glance about the slightly spartan female rider, he enjoys riding his motorbike, seeing spectacular views, eating delicious food, and relaxing in a hot spring. Gradually, the man's feelings begin to change.\nThis book contains a two-part short story and one one-shot story from before the author became a serialized writer.\ntranslated from amazon.jp",
