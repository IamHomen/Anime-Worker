And to make matters worse, each student at the academy gains a special kind of magic\u2014or more like a curse, really. Arumi suddenly finds herself blurting out thoughts she never would've dreamed of saying aloud before. Luckily, there's a way to rid oneself of this magic. But unlucky for her, it involves a long and hard process.",
