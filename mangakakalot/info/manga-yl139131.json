  "description": "Description :\r\n        A hero who dies in a fight with the Demon King is cursed on the verge of death. The curse was to reincarnate the hero as Rama, the daughter of a half-ogre and a half-human. Sixteen years have passed since then. Rama, who was reincarnated in an ogre village, was tormented by discrimination and prejudice because of her origin, but she had grown beyond the confines of the ogre village, making use of her experience as a former hero. The village chief, who has taken notice of her, gives her an order. The order was to select Rama as the new \u201cDemon King Candidate\u201d from the Ogre village.A genuine otherworldly fantasy about a former hero torn between \u201chumans\u201d and \u201cogres\u201d. The story begins!",
