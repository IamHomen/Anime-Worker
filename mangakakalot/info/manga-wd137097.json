  "description": "Description :\r\n        Aki Uchiyama, the writer who led the \"bishojo\" (beautiful girl) and \"lolicon boom\" in adult magazines, brought the flavor of his works published in adult magazines directly to boys' magazines in this extremely problematic work. Although the story is styled as a science fiction fantasy comedy about a pretty elementary school girl named Tsukasa, who is a test subject for a strange invention. She is made to wear underwear, diapers, and half-naked clothes, not to mention all the tricks she's played on. Perverse and erotic expressions are the main themes of the works. The author, Aki Uchiyama, also published an adult-oriented self-parody work, \"Ankoro-Trio,\" at about the same time as this work.While originally published as shonen, later prints are labeled for adults.",
