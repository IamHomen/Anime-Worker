  "description": "Description :\r\n        Average... the word that Tatsumi has been tormented with from his childhood all the way up to college, and he's developed an inferiority complex. In a desperate attempt to reinvent himself, he acts as a \"compulsive kisser\" ever since he got drunk. In a drinking party with his club, Kuga, one of the most popular guys there, catches Tatsumi's eyes. Noticing Kuga's glance, Tatsumi runs to the bathroom feeling strangely self-conscious, where he ends up coming face to face with Kuga. Tatsumi wants to avoid the awkward tension and makes for the door, but Kuga stops him. \"Why am I the only person you don't kiss?\"",
