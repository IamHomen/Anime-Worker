Haruka Nanami, a sophomore in high school,  receives a confession from Kudo Satoru, a student at a neighboring high school. Haruka is at a loss, saying, \"I've never even talked to him before...\" Kudo suggests that they start out as friends, and the two exchange contact information. At the same time, at a railroad crossing in the town where the two live, a series of similar accidents occur day after day. They are madly in love. They want to be together, but they can't. A midsummer horror love story that you will never forget.",
