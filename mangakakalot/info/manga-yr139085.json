  "description": "Description :\r\n        **What is a *Human*?**This is a world in which monsters and demons live. Every few years, a *Human* appears, almost as if they are reborn here.  These *Humans* require great care when picking food for them. They become sick at the slightest change in temperature. They get hurt from the smallest of falls.  But *Humans*, unlike Une (dogs), Nosa (cats), and Eshigu (rabbits), have a unique kind of loyalty and intelligence, and even something endearing about them...  A diary manga about an encounter and their daily life. Along with its illustrated guide, this book is a great pickup for first-time *Human* owners!",
