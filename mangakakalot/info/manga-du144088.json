  "description": "Description :\r\n        A boyfriend whose love is so strong it becomes smothering - \"Sena, look only at me.\" - an impudently wicked underclassman - \"You should just break up with that boyfriend of yours.\" - and the girl wavering between them on a seesaw of love! Since Sena struggles to speak her mind, her boyfriend Minoru worries and has been taking extra care to watch over her. Then one day, Sena decides to attend her school club's drinking party after Hayato, an underclassman in the same club, asks for her help. She's always turned down the parties before to avoid worrying Minoru, and the moment she tells him she's going to one, his whole demeanor suddenly changes... While she's tossed about like a ship in a storm, which man will Sena choose in the end...?!",
