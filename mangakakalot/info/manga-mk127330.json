  "description": "Description :\r\n        The sun's rays enter the city of light, as various stories unfold: \u00a0\nBright, dark and harsh; a story filled with people from whom you'd want to avert your eyes. Yet, it's close to reality; so maybe it's true to humanity. \u00a0\nLike an old bond between a boy and a girl, a friendship is born between girls who rarely speak to each other. \u00a0\nA man who dirties his hands for money, and the girlfriend who waits for him to come home.",
