  "description": "Description :\r\n        Yara Cross is a last year Senior, an outcast looking to just finish her studies quietly before graduation. That is until the very boy, Ame Osmond, the ex-friend that isolated her, then went missing, now suddenly turns up again covered in burn scars and story that doesn't check out. Unable to shake the care of her old friend, she persists in trying to break through to him, but the more she uncovers of the truth, the more she starts to realize perhaps the reason he pushed her away two years ago was for her own protection. Wanting to still help him but getting too close for her own good, Yara is pulled into a supernatural Turf war of Angels, Fallen and Devils. Nothing like the books of faith and made of the stuff of nightmares, can Yara survive in a war beyond humans?",
