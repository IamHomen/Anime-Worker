  "description": "Description :\r\n        In Meng Zhao's eyes, Lu Shichen in the past looked like a paper sack wrapped in skin, looking calm from a distance but terrifying up close. So, at that time, everyone was chasing Lu Shichen, but Meng Zhao found him so fake that he hated him. Meng Zhao never expected that one day he would be able to meet Lu Shichen, and even less that he would become the prime suspect in a murder case... And it turns out that the person who is in charge of resolving this case is none other than Detective Meng Zhao.",
