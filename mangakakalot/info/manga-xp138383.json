  "description": "Description :\r\n        Feng Linxi was forced into the palace at a young age, becoming the empress dowager's puppet and impersonating the emperor on the throne. She does nothing all day, so she just keeps harassing the regent, Xiao Chu. Xiao Chu wields all the power in the court and wants nothing more than to usurp the throne, so he could not care less about Feng Linxi's constant flirting. All Feng Linxi gets for her trouble is more punishment from the empress dowager. At first her plight looks hopeless, but after an assassination attempt by the empress dowager, it seems that romance might still blossom between the two of them",
