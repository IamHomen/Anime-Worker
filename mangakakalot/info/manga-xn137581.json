  "description": "Description :\r\n        In a novel I gave up reading, I became the first character that will be killed by the tyrant. And I am supposed to be the etiquette teacher for the tyrant-to-be? \"Are you saying that kicking the would-be emperor is a classy thing to do?\" \"If you don't like my educational policies, ask to change your etiquette teacher.\" I've kicked, punched , and ripped his hair off, all for the sake of losing my job. \"When you hit, avoid my bones. Hit me in the thighs or chest. If you think you're going to hurt me, you'd better scratch or bite.\" What is this crazy guy saying now? \"You are the first person who has ever looked at my scars in such a way.\" This guy who says you're the first person who's ever pitied him, the first person who's ever petted him, is actually a big, affection-deprived puppy. \"Don't just take pity on him, you'll soon be in a passionate love affair that will shake the empire!\"Read The Tyrant's Etiquette Tutor on mangabuddy+",
