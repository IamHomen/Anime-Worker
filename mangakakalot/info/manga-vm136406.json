  "description": "Description :\r\n        Li Qing came to a world where there are immortals and Sages who can cultivate, yet he cannot find anyone to teach him their cultivation methods. Did he cross over only to end up an ordinary person? Fortunately, Li Qing has a characteristic that others don\u2019t have. As long as he reads the books of the sages and comprehends their wisdom, he can understand the principles of the sages and cultivate righteous qi in his body. While others cultivate immortality, I read books. This is his own path of Confucianism! To establish virtue, achieve merit, and speak with authority, he aims to embody the three timeless qualities of a scholar! He seeks to prove the way of Confucianism!",
