  "description": "Description :\r\n        Tsukiwaka might be a fan of cute and girly things, but actually he can\u2019t handle women well. One day, a strange, beautiful woman named Hinako showed up on his campus. She handed a hand-made lunch box to Tsukiwaka while smiling, \u201cI am your wife.\u201d\nSince he is bad with women, Tsukiwaka thought he could resist such an unexpected self-declaration, but why does Hinako make his heart race? Should Tsukiwaka go along with her play?",
