It\u2019s the worst and the best second-life high school rom-com ever.\nLove, friendship, and the sparkling joys of youth. The high school life that I\u2019ve looked forward to- still ended with me being alone. Then, just a day before the graduation ceremony\u2026\n\u201cDon\u2019t die! Nanamura-kun!\u201d\nSora Hanamitsuji, she\u2019s a beautiful girl that even models can\u2019t compare to. My life ended after getting hit by a truck to protect her. \u2026That should\u2019ve been the case.\n\u201cIt must be because the gods got bored.\u201d\nHowever, with this accident, Hanamitsuji-san and I returned to the day of our high school\u2019s entrance ceremony. The second high school life is no longer as charming and youthful. I was going to spend it modestly and alone. \u2026But, she said that won\u2019t do.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll help you make friends.\u201d\nThis is a story about my second high school life. It\u2019s the worst and best teenage rom-com ever.",
