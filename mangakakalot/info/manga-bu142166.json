  "description": "Description :\r\n        \"I'm going to celebrate Chitose's birthday so hard!\"\n\nChitose, a college student, recalls the words of one of his high school classmates on the night of his birthday, which he spends in solitude.\n\nKoutaka, a tall, handsome, and athletic boy who transferred to his school in his second year of high school, was a battery partner on the baseball team. When Chitose is assigned to be a battery partner with him on the baseball team, he learns of his unsociable nature and is attracted to him. The two gradually become aware of each other and begin dating.\n\nChitose is happy to be dating his first boyfriend, but he and Takataka cross paths when they start talking about their career paths.\n\nGraduation comes and goes, and he no longer keeps in touch with Takataka. The message screen has remained static for two years. Chitose finally sends a new message to Takataka.\n\nThis is a painfully realistic adolescent love story of a blunt guy and a flawed college student !",
