  "description": "Description :\r\n        With the decline of the Galactic Empire, the Milky Way has dissolved into a confusion of warring leaders. One of the strongest of these warlords manages to defeat the imperial Asou Shuzen, and take the remaining imperial family member, the Princess Shimon, as a prisoner. Will she be able to become something more than a pawn in her captor's ambitious plans of conquest? In the meantime Ryuga Rai, a solider of Shusen Army, has become fed up with his leader after returning from a battle with only 3 surviving soldiers in his band. But all Rai's defiance gains him is a glimpse of Princess Shimon and an unwanted place in the warlord's wild daughter's bed. What will future hold for Rai and for the galaxy?  ---**Links:**  - (https://twitter.com/glc09bk88pgot7u)  - (https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2225)",
