However, there is no rest for the weary as a figure stirs from within the site of the battle...\nAt the same time, another figure stands before the gates of Kyoushou. Upon closer inspection, it turns out to be a high school girl with a ponytail, wearing a jersey and toting a rucksack. She smashes aside all Kyoushou fighters who try to stop her. Occupying the academy's P.A. room, she issues her challenge: \"I am\u00a0Ryoushuu's\u00a0Bachou Mouki! Fight me, Sousou Moutoku!\"\nThe peace won at Chibi is short-lived. Despite the recent setback, Sousou Moutoku is fast recuperating his power. In addition, a new faction arises in the form of\u00a0Nanban High School.",
