Whether she's hanging out with her friends Nana Ebina and Kirie Motoba, or competing with her self-proclaimed \"rival\" Sylphinford Tachibana, Umaru knows how to kick back and have some fun!\r\n\r\nHimouto! Umaru-chan is a cute story that follows the daily adventures of Umaru and Taihei, as they take care of\u2014and put up with\u2014each other the best they can, as well as the unbreakable bonds between friends and siblings.",
