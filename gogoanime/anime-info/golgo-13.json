Anyone can hire him, including private citizens and world governments. If he\u2019s not bedding women he\u2019s infiltrating a hostile country, waiting hours for the perfect shot in the most extreme conditions.\nGolgo 13 is just as adept in the urban jungle. Those who deal with him must make sure not to cross the Duke or they might find themselves the target of his rifle.",
