  "synopsis": "Ryouta Satou, who died from overworking at a black company, was reincarnated to another world. Although Ryouta was alive, he was now burdened with the inconvenience that his level is fixed to 1 in this new world. Although he wasn\u2019t able to raise his level, he had a unique skill that can create a cheat-like item that shouldn't exist in the world from monsters. Knowing this, he maxed out his stats with the help of ability-up items, and he gathered a number of weapons and items that can only be used by himself, which made him have the strongest stats and gear despite being level 1.",
