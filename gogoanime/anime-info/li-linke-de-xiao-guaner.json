  "synopsis": "In Beijing, a city where modernity echoes with traditional culture, where opportunities coexist with challenges, hides a bistro in a quiet alley at the foot of CBD. Different cultures and elements collide and fuse in THE BISTRO OF LI LINKE. You might easily miss it since there is no striking signboards or luxurious decorations. But all of its patrons know this comfy tiny bistro is the go-to place where you can pull yourself back from daytime fatigue and just relax, maybe even share your buried memories with the person that sits right next to you.",
