To combat these threats, teenagers gifted with supernatural abilities called \"Talents\"\u2014such as pyrokinesis and time travel\u2014hone their powers at an academy on a secluded island.\r\n\r\nNanao Nakajima, however, is quite different from the others on the island: he has no Talent. With many \"Talented\" teenagers around him, Nanao is often a target for bullying, but even so, he still strives to complete his training. Soon after, two transfer students, the mysterious Kyouya Onodera and the mind-reading Nana Hiiragi, join the class. But just as everyone starts blending as comrades-in-arms, mysterious disappearances begin to threaten the class's entire foundation.",
