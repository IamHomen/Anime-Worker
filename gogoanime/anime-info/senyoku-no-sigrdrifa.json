  "synopsis": "The Pillars suddenly appeared above Earth, threatening all life. A god who called himself Odin came to the aid of humanity as it was driven to near complete defeat. To counter the Pillars, Odin declared a counterattack by bequeathing humanity with the battle maidens Walk\u00fcres and the \"herocraft\" as their wings.\r\n\r\nSeveral years later, the battle between humanity and Pillars rages on, with men supporting the Walk\u00fcres as they soar through the treacherous skies to save the world.\r\n\r\nJapan is no exception. Three Walk\u00fcres confront the giant Pillar looming over sacred Mt. Fuji. Each Walk\u00fcre is skilled, but each also has issues. And now, an ace pilot has arrived from Europe.\r\n\r\n\"Now is the time to fight back, humanity. The day of reckoning has arrived. The time of Ragnarok draws nears.\"",
