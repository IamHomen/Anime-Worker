Without much ado she drags along her childhood friend, the shy, mature, and sensitive\u00a0Akiyama Mio\u00a0(bass).\nThat leaves only two more members, required to keep club from closing. Luckily the gentle, calm, warm, and cute\u00a0Kotobuki Tsumugi(keyboard) stumbles into the club, only to be \"convinced\" by the pleading Ritsu to stay. The last member, the easily distracted klutz\u00a0Hirasawa Yui, can only play castanets, even though the club needs someone on the guitar, but she is \"bribed\" \u2014 with cake \u2014 to stay anyway.Will Yui be able to learn to play the guitar \u2014 the special one she just bought and loves so much \u2014 before the four girls graduate?",
