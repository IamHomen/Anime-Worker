  "synopsis": "Mobile Suit SD Gundam Mk II delivers with more tongue-in-cheek humor than the first series. In \"The Rolling Colony Affair,\" a colony is hosting a cabaret show featuring the girls of Gundam. But the show turns disastrous when men and mobile suits go crazy over the girls, sending the colony rolling out of control. A parody of the videogame RPG genre, \"Gundam Legend\" has Amuro, Kamille and Judau sent on a perilous quest to rescue the princess of the Zeta Kingdom from Char Aznable and his vicious Zeon MS forces.",
