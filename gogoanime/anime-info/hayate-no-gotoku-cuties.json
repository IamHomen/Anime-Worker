Desperately trying alter his hapless fate, he decides to kidnap someone to hold for a ransom. Due to an ill choice of words, the girl he tries to kidnap misunderstands the action as a confession of love. His plan is totally crushed when he gives his real name out.

In a desperate attempt to avoid that fate, Hayate decides to become a \u201cbad guy\u201d and kidnap someone to be held for ransom, but his efforts to do so are mistaken as a confession of love by the girl he targets.",
