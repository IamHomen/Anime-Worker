  "synopsis": "This is a world where evil beings are gradually becoming rampant. However, no matter how strong these evil beings are, they all disappear without a trace behind this psychiatric hospital, even indignantly reduced to food ingredients and pets. This is Qing Shan Psychiatric Hospital, a place renowned for its abundant talents and surrounded by strong figures. Regarding this, Lin Fan, a severely ill patient with a system, states: I am definitely not a psychiatric patient; I am a normal person who likes to cultivate. Normally, I just touch electrical outlets, climb high-voltage boxes, and during thunderstorms, I stand on the rooftop performing stick techniques for the heavens.",
