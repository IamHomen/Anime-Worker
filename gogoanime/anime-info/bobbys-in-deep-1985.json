  "synopsis": "* Based on a short story by\u00a0Kataoka Yoshio.The 17-year-old\u00a0Nomura Akihiko, called\u00a0Bobby, is an underachieving high school kid with a deep love for motorcycles. His grades are failing, and his father \u2014 traditional and strict is trying everything he can think of to get the kid to apply for college. His mother is so silent, she might as well not even exist. Really, his support system lies entirely in his twinkle-toed little sister, the 14-year-old\u00a0Keiko, who is nosy but cheers him on in her own way.Bobby really does little else but work on his bike. His most recent achievement seems to have been getting photos of himself on a road trip printed in a motorcyclist hobby magazine.This leads to an unexpected result: A girl his age,\u00a0Nakahara Sakumi, who picked up that issue on a whim, decides to write him a letter. A romantic letter...Note: Shown on a double bill with\u00a0Kamui no Ken.",
