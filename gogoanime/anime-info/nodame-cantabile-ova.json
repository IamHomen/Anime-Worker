But when Chiaki and the teacher get into a fight, he\u2019s demoted to the reject class. Chiaki is left to pursue his dream of being a conductor while surrounded by a bunch of loser musicians and one annoying girl, Noda, who has proclaimed herself Chiaki\u2019s girlfriend. It doesn\u2019t help that Noda, who insists on being called Nodame, lives right next door to him.",
