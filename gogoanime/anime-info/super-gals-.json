  "synopsis": "Ran Kotobuki is well-known as the #1 gal in Shibuya, and she lives to shop, eat, and have as much fun as possible. But she\u2019s not all faux nails and para para; in the midst of all of her goofing off, she protects Shibuya from all manner of undesirable people, and she often devotes herself to helping both friends and strangers out of trouble, big and small. Of course, she\u2019d rather be eating free food and scoring good deals on clothes, but getting someone out of a big pinch can be just as fun for her.\nBecause of this, she\u2019s widely respected by the denizens of Shibuya, and although she may look (and even act) a bit shallow, she\u2019s got a big heart and a sense of justice that could put her Police Chief father to shame. But she\u2019s not interested in that line of work, much to her family\u2019s dismay. All she wants is to hang out with her best friends Miyu and Aya, and continue spending her days as Shibuya\u2019s #1 gal.",
