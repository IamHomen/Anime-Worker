  "synopsis": "In the year 2072, the world's energy problems seem solved by a network of cross-dimensional electric-field inductors\u2014\"coils\"\u2014that extract energy from a seemingly infinite source. That source is the W dimension, a fourth plane that exists beyond the X, Y, and Z dimensions.\r\n\r\nIn this world, unofficial \"illegal\" coils harness powers that the police can't hope to counter. Dealing with these coils is the job of coil-hating repo man Kyoma, whose run-in with the unique coil android Mira leads the two to form a reluctant partnership.",
