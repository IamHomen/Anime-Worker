One day, he meets a party of girls (a priestess, a warrior and a thief) looking for a mage to join them to open a ruin entrance, but they absolutely rejects him due to his pathetic magic skills. But he refuses to be rejected, and then he tries to join them by force, only to interrupting a sacred ritual of Melissa (the priestess), revealing Louie as her master.\n Now, as the will of god Miley says, they have no choice but to accept them, and here begins the whole new adventure for this \u201cmage\u201d \u00a0 Louie, a brawny student at the mage\u2019s guild, is reluctantly accepted by three girls (Merrill-thief, Genie-fighter, and Melissa-priestess) as a companion for their adventuring party.
