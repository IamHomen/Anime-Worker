Considered to be the king of lateness at his school, he's never finished a single thing that he's started, simply because it doesn't look cool if he can't do it.\nBut it all changes when, one day, his childhood friend Yukino Maiko invites him to the only thing he'll ever finish... deep beneath Tokyo, there is a secret building run by Rion. It is here that the most powerful Virtual Reality technology resides... in the hands of the powerful corporation, Rion. With it, they have created an addictive game where you control a dragon. It is called Dragon Drive.\u00a0\nIts no surprise when Reiji gets his dragon... a small white dragon -- thats sleeping!
