Until then, Kaoru was an honor roll student who tended to keep to himself, but meeting notorious bad boy Sentaro Kawabuchi starts to change him.\nThrough his devil-may-care classmate, Kaoru learns the attractions of jazz and finds the first person he can call a \u201cfriend\u201d. He also discovers how much fun it is to play music with a pal. Other characters include Sentaro\u2019s kind childhood chum, Ritsuko, who is the daughter of a record shop owner; the mysterious upperclassman, Yurika; and Brother Jun, the much-admired leader among their peers. Set against the backdrop of a seaside town with a scent of American culture, this series is a drama about young people coming into their own, crossing each other\u2019s paths, and finding friendship, love, and music!",
