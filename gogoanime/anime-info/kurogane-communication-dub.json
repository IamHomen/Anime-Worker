Spike, the youngest robot, serves as her best friend, Cleric advises her, and Angela destroys her enemies.\r\n\r\nWith Toriga, the world's angriest and least effective combat robot, and Reeves, the meanest-looking machine ever to wear a frilly pink apron, they protect her and search for other survivors.",
