Mato tries her best to make conversation with Yomi, wanting to befriend her. At first, she is avoided, but the ice breaks when Yomi happens to notice a decorative blue bird attached to Mato's phone, which is from the book \"Li'l Birds At Play.\" Discovering they have a common interest, the two form a strong friendship.\r\n\r\nIn an alternate universe, the young girls exist as parallel beings, Mato as Black\u2605Rock Shooter, and Yomi as Dead Master.
