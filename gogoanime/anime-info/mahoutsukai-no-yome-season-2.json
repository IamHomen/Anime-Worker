  "synopsis": "Second season of Mahoutsukai no Yome.\r\n\r\nApprentice mage Chise Hatori is invited to enroll at the College, a prestigious learning institution for sorcerers, to examine and look for a way to remove the curses she bears. Despite her groom Elias Ainsworth's reluctance, Chise accepts the proposal, as she believes attending the school might help her minimize her self-sacrificing tendencies.\r\n\r\nFrom the get-go, Chise grabs the attention of her classmates and professors alike, who have never seen a mage in action before. However, there is a sinister plot brewing behind the College's back, and the young mage will have to determine who is friend or foe in order to put a stop to it.",
