The five-year-old is a cut above the most troublesome, perverted, and shameless kid one can imagine.

The exemplary troublemaker has done it all and has no plans to stop anytime soon.\nCrayon Shin-chan follows the daily shenanigans of Shin-chan with his group of friends, parading around as the self-proclaimed \"Kasukabe Defense Force.\" The adults witnessing these shenanigans unfold can't help but adore Shin-chan, as he keeps them entertained while unintentionally solving their daily troubles through his mindless antics\u2014leaving himself as the only problem they do not know what to do with.",
