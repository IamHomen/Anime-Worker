  "synopsis": "This is a story of connecting shining emotions.\r\n\r\nJoy, sadness, anger. Feelings are a power, invisible to the eye, that every person possesses. Sometimes this power is even capable of changing the world.\r\n\r\nHiori Hirahara always has a positive attitude and can't leave people in trouble alone. Ruki Hanari is socially awkward, she wants to get along well with others, but she doesn't know how to go about it.\r\n\r\nHow will the meeting of these two wildly different girls change not only them, but the world itself?",
