  "synopsis": "Kagome\u00a0leads a fairly normal life, in spite of her weird family. Her house is a thousand-year-old Japanese temple, and her grandfather talks about the history of the house endlessly. Legend has it that the old well on the temple grounds keeps a vicious ancient monster at bay; Kagome never believed those legends, until now. The well opens up and sucked Kagome inside transporting her to an ancient time of enchanted forests and giant demons.\nKagome is soon confronted by her odd resemblance to\u00a0Kikyou, the girl who controlled the magical\u00a0Shikon no Tama\u00a0talisman and imprisoned the legendary half-demon\u00a0InuYasha. Upon entering this fantasy world, Kagome is attacked by a demon hunting the\u00a0Shikon no Tama; she unwittingly releases InuYasha from his imprisonment, only to find that he's no hero.",
