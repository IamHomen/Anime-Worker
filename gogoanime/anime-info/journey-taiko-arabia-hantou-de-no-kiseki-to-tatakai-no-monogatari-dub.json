  "synopsis": "From the south of the Arabian Peninsula, the great General Abraha and his mighty army trample their way north to the holy city of Mecca. Their demands are ruthless: Mecca's surrender, its people's enslavement, and the Kaaba's destruction. Despite advice to withdraw and save themselves, a few brave Meccan men remain to fight. Among them is Aws Ibn Jubair, a humble potter who abandoned a life of sin to dedicate himself to honor and faith.\r\n\r\nAs the enemy troops approach in the dead of night, the vastly outnumbered Meccans work to raise morale. The night takes an unexpected shift with the reappearance of an atheist mercenary named Zurara\u2014Aws' old accomplice who never went straight. Although Zurara joins only for food and pay, the intriguing tale of Aws' path to religion convinces him that Mecca is worth protecting. Bracing for the inevitable bloodbath, the two former friends reunite to defend the only land and faith that allow them to truly forgive themselves.",
