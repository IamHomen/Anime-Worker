  "synopsis": "Plot Summary:According to an ancient legend, mermaid\u2019s flesh can grant immortality if eaten. 500 years ago, Yuta unknowingly ate a piece of mermaid\u2019s flesh. For centuries, he travels across Japan, hoping to find a mermaid, thinking she may be able to make him a normal human again. When he finally finds one, he discovers that she and her companions have been raising a girl to be their food so they can eat her and take on her youthful looks.\nThat is how mermaids stay young. Yuta kills the mermaids and rescues her, but she has already eaten some of the mermaid\u2019s flesh. Although he had to kill the mermaids, Yuta isn\u2019t too disappointed. Yuta\u2019s once lonely existence is now over, as he has found a companion in Mana. And Mana, who had been trapped in a small hut her whole life, finds delight in even the simplest of things. Together, Yuta and Mana attempt to seek out more mermaids, trying to become normal humans again.",
