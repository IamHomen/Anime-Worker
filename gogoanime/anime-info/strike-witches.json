  "synopsis": "It was the year 1939 when the\u00a0Neuroi\u00a0appeared. Nobody knows where they came from or what their ultimate agenda is, but the fact remains that their attacks drove people out of their towns and cities.\nIn order to take arms against them, humanity develops a new anti-Neuroi weapon called the\u00a0Striker Unit. Using the power of magic to fight against the monsters, this new device enhances and amplifies the power of female magic-wielders. To use this device, young witches from all over the world have been brought together to form an elite task force unit called the\u00a0501st Joint Fighter Wing, commonly known as the\u00a0Strike Witches.",
