  "synopsis": "Ever since\u00a0Kotoura Haruka\u00a0was a little girl, she was able to read the minds of those surrounding her. And even though this\u00a0gift\u00a0may be special, in her life so far it only had devastating results: Her innocent babbling led to the divorce of her parents, who then left her with her grandfather. And in school Haruka loses all her friends, since none of them would or could admit the truths Haruka was able to so easily\u00a0read\u00a0in their minds.\nHaruka transfers to a new school, but has no hope of finding friends, and thus decides to keep quiet about her ability. That is, until she meets\u00a0Manabe Yoshihisa, an\u00a0imaginative\u00a0slightly perverted boy, who becomes her first true friend, vowing to always stand by her side. Soon the enthusiastic\u00a0Mifune Yuriko, president of the\u00a0Paranormal Society\u00a0(ESP) club, learns of Haruka's ability and vehemently invites her \u2014 literally dragging her off \u2014 to join the club. There the club's only other member, the under-tall, level-headed vice president\u00a0Muroto Daichi\u00a0welcomes her. Both Yuriko and Daichi readily accept Haruka... and for the first time she is happy, surrounded by friends, who do not treat her like a freak.",
