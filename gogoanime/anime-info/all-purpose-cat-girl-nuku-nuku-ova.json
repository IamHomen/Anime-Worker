Along the way, the son gets out of the Jeep to satisfy an urge of nature, and comes back with a cat. At this point, gunfire erupts around them, and they try to get away. They succeed, but the cat was killed by a stray bullet.\nSometime later, the son attends school with his \"big sister\" named\u00a0Nuku Nuku. Yes, this is the android \u2014 who now looks like a cute girl \u2014 with the brain of the dead cat. Of course, things do not stay peaceful for long; the boy's mother wants him back! And so the fast-paced action comedy begins.",
