After a set of Tiger Fist, he directly broke through to the triple realm of martial arts that can become a disciple of an outside sect. However, even though he got rid of his identity as a sword slave and became an outer disciple, Lin Yun was still discriminated against by other disciples of the sect, all because of the unwritten rule of \"one day a sword slave, a lifetime a sword slave\"... The road to martial arts is full of hardships. How does Lin Yun constantly challenge himself, find opportunities for improvement, break the sect's grievances, rewrite the life of a sword slave, and step into the pinnacle of martial arts?",
