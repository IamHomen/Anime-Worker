Now that Haruka Nanase and Makoto Tachibana are senior students, along with their younger friends Nagisa Hazuki and Rei Ryuugazaki, they have to find a way to attract new members. If not, the club will be forced to close the following year due to a lack of membership.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with impending graduation, it is also time for the seniors to decide their plans for the future.
