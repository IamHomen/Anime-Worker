That castle is home to the magnificent wizard Howl, infamous for both his magical prowess and for being a womanizer\u2014or so the rumor goes in Sophie Hatter's small town. Sophie, as the plain daughter of a hatmaker, does not expect much from her future and is content with working hard in the shop. \r\n\r\nHowever, Sophie's simple life takes a turn for the exciting when she is ensnared in a disturbing situation, and the mysterious wizard appears to rescue her. Unfortunately, this encounter, brief as it may be, spurs the vain and vengeful Witch of the Waste\u2014in a fit of jealousy caused by a past discord with Howl\u2014to put a curse on the maiden, turning her into an old woman.\r\n\r\nIn an endeavor to return to normal, Sophie must accompany Howl and a myriad of eccentric companions\u2014ranging from a powerful fire demon to a hopping scarecrow\u2014in his living castle, on a dangerous adventure as a raging war tears their kingdom apart.",
