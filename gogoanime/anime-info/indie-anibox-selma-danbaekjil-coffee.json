  "synopsis": "The 2008 animated omnibus Indie Anibox: Selma's Protein Coffee consists of three inventive short films from up-and-coming directors. Kim Woon Ki's kooky mystery thriller \"Wanted\" is set in a peaceful village suddenly disrupted by heavy rainfall and the appearance of a strange old woman named Selma. Yeon Sang Ho's 3-D animation \"Love is Protein\" is an inventive black comedy about three poor roommates who break their piggy banks to order fried chicken - only to discover their prospective meal is the son of a weeping chicken. Jang Hyung Yoon's surreal \"A Coffee Vending Machine and Its Sword\" follows a swordsman who reincarnates as a coffee vending machine and falls in love at first sight with the maintenance girl.",
