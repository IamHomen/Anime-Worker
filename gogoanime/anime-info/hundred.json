To become a Slayer, a master of military arts who wields this Hundred, Kisaragi Hayato enrolls in the marine academy city ship Little Garden. However, Hayato feels a strange yet familiar sense of incongruity towards Emile Crossford, his roommate who somehow knows him from somewhere. On top of that, as soon as he enters the school, he is challenged to a duel by the Queen, the school's most powerful Slayer, Claire Harvey.",
