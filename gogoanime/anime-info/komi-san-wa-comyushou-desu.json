There's just one problem though\u2014despite her popularity, Shouko is terrible at communicating with others.\nHitohito Tadano is your average high school boy. With his life motto of \"read the situation and make sure to stay away from trouble,\" he quickly finds that sitting next to Shouko has made him the enemy of everyone in his class! One day, knocked out by accident, Hitohito later wakes up to the sound of Shouko's \"meow.\" He lies that he heard nothing, causing Shouko to run away. But before she can escape, Hitohito surmises that Shouko is not able to talk to others easily\u2014in fact, she has never been able to make a single friend.
