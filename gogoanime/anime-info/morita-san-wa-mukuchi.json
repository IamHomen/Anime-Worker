  "synopsis": "\u201cMorita-san wa Mukuchi\u201d is about Morita Mayu, a highschool girl who rarely speaks. The reason behind it is not because she doesn\u2019t like to talk nor because she has nothing to say. The reason she rarely speaks is due to the fact she thinks too much before speaking, thus losing the timing to speak altogether .",
