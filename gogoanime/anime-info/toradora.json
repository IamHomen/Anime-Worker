  "synopsis": "Despite Ryuji Takasu\u2019s gentle personality, his eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent so he is utterly hopeless about his chances of getting a girlfriend anytime soon, and does not have many close friends either. After being greeted by his hungover mother in the morning, Ryuji goes to school and is happy to find that he gets to be in the same class as his best friend Yusaku Kitamura and crush Minori Kushieda.\nHowever, it is then that he unexpectedly knocks into \u201cthe school\u2019s most dangerous animal of the highest risk level\u201d \u2014 Taiga Aisaka \u2014 who just happens to also be in his class, and is a good friend of Minori. Despite Ryuji Takasu\u2019s gentle personality, his eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent. Class rearrangements on his second high school year put him together with his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, and his hidden crush, Minori Kushieda. Along with these two comes Kushieda\u2019s best friend, Taiga Aisaka. Her delicate appearance contrasts with her brutal personality. Secretly in love with Kitamura, Taiga agrees to help Ryuji with his love interest as long as he helps her get closer to hers. It\u2019s a new school year and Ryuuji Takasu discovers not only is he in the same class as his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, but also Minori Kukshieda whom he\u2019s had an undisclosed crush on for quite some time. Along with Kitamura and Minori is Minori\u2019s best friend, the \u201cPalmtop Tiger\u201d, tiny Taiga Aisaka whom, despite her small stature, takes nothing from nobody. (When unflattering pictures of her in a bathing suit were circulated, \u201cOf course, I made it rain blood in the photography club.\u201d) Taiga is secretly in love with Kitamura and she and Ryuuji, despite an oil and water relationship, agree to mutually support each other in their quests for their heart\u2019s desire.
