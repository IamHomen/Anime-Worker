But it's becoming harder to keep up with his growing responsibilities and deadlines, especially after his last two assistants quit to follow their dreams. Just as he\u2019s nearing his breaking point, the beautiful and scarily competent Shiori Goshiki applies to become his new assistant. But there\u2019s something almost otherworldly about Goshiki, and soon Kuga finds his reality turned upside down when she suddenly declares them engaged to marry!",
