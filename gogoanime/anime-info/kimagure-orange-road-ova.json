The main character,\u00a0Kasuga\u00a0has a few telekinetic powers which are often used for comedic effect. He is also quite indecisive. The other main characters are Madoka and Hikaru. Most of the time, Madoka acts like a tough girl who can do anything and Hikaru demonstrates extreme cheerfulness. The stories generally follow Kasuga in his relationship with Madoka and Hikaru.",
