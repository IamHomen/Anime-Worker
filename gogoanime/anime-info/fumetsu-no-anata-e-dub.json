Capable of changing forms from beings whose reflections It captures, It first becomes a rock and then, due to the rising temperature, moss.\r\n\r\nIt is inept of movement until one snowy day, a wolf at death's door barely crosses by. When It takes the animal's form, It attains awareness of its consciousness and starts to wander with an unclear destination in mind. Soon, It comes across the wolf's master\u2014a young boy waiting for his tribe to return from a paradise abundant with fish and fruit in the south.

However, with a heavily injured body and no sight of his elder comrades, what will become of the boy?\r\n\r\nFumetsu no Anata e illustrates the story of an immortal being experiencing humanity, meeting all types of people in many places throughout time.",
