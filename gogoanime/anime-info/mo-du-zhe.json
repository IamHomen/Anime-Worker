  "synopsis": "Childhood, upbringing, family background, social relations, traumatic experiences...\r\nWe keep reviewing and seeking out the motives of criminals, exploring the subtlest emotions driving them. It\u2019s not to put ourselves in their shoes and sympathize, or even forgive them; it\u2019s not to find some reasons to exculpate their crimes; it\u2019s not to kneel down before the so-called \"complexity of human nature\"; nor to introspect social conflicts, much less to alienate ourselves into monsters.\r\nWe just want to have a fair trial \u2013 for ourselves and for those who still have hope for the world.",
