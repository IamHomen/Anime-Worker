To his dismay, he finds himself reincarnated as a vending machine in another world. Having reemerged within a forest inhabited by frogmen and other monsters\u2014and supplied with only two products\u2014Boxxo the Vending Machine requires coins to keep itself stocked, powered, and upgraded with new skills.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the automat is rescued by a young woman who quickly realizes that it is sentient, and she carries it to a human settlement. Thereafter, the strange piece of machinery gradually makes an impact in the world around it, gaining numerous allies along the way despite being utterly incapable of speech or movement and communicating only by playing out pre-recorded vending machine phrases.",
