  "synopsis": "A person who has traveled all over the green mountains is still young, but when he suddenly looks back, the sword is just between his eyebrows, but in his heart. Jing Jiu, who lives in a mountain village in Chaotian Continent, unexpectedly receives Liu Shisui, who is born with Taoism, as a book boy. The two came to the Qingshan Sect by chance, but they were criticized because the \"mediocre\" Jing Jiu actually took the \"extraordinary genius\" Liu Shisui as his servant. At the sword inheritance conference, Jing Jiu also met Zhao Layue, a Sanwu girl from Shenmo Peak. Jing Jiu, who is surprisingly \"lazy\", just wants to practice quietly, but little does he know that fate will involve the three of them in a huge river and lake dispute... Under the Taixu, are the green mountains far away? Not far.",
