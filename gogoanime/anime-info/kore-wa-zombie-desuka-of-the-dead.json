However, he is resurrected as a zombie by the necromancer girl\u00a0Eu, whom he had befriended just before dying. When Ayumu reawakens he is tossed into a world with\u00a0masou shoujo\u00a0(magically equipped girls) and vampire ninjas.

And so life, as it is, with short-tempered vampire ninja\u00a0Seraphim, chainsaw-wielding prodigy masou shoujo Haruna, and mute necromancer Eu continues under one roof.Late after school, to avoid getting sunburned, Ayumu encounters the alcohol-prone fairy\u00a0Chris. This overly cute\u00a0adult\u00a0in a childs body is up to something... life at school could be so peaceful, if it were not for the enemies of the masou shoujo.",
