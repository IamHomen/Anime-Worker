The guy spent his wedding night in a bridesmaid's bed, and wandered into a brothel in search of a meal. Now his beautiful wife has lost all faith in him, and his father-in-law exiled him to the training grounds in disgust. And all Xu Wuzhou got for this trouble was an ancient artifact starving for blood?",
