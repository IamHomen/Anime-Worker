On this planet that was completely flooded by the seas, people live in fleets of giant ships, salvaging relics from the seas' depths in order to survive.Red arrives on one of the fleets called Gargantia. With no knowledge of the planet's history or culture, he is forced to live alongside\u00a0Amy, a 15-year-old girl who serves as a messenger aboard the Gargantia fleet. To Red, who has lived a life where he knows nothing but fighting, these days of peace continue to surprise him.",
