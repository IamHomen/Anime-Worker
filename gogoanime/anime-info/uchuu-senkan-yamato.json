With only one year before complete and utter extermination, time is fast running out and hope is in short supply.\r\n\r\nSo far, any attempt to escape or retaliate has been instantly annihilated by the alien empire\u2014until an emergency transmission from the planet Iscandar in a neighboring galaxy offers a glimmer of hope to save the doomed planet. Covertly, Earth's Self Defense Force constructs a faster than light engine for a journey to Iscandar. Armed with new weapons and a determined crew of fearless navy men, the World War II era battleship Yamato is reborn as Space Battleship Yamato. She and her crew set out on a perilous journey across the stars to save their home and the entire human race.",
