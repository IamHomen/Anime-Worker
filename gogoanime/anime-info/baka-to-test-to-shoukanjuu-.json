His academy rigidly divides up the student body into classes based on the results of tests.\nThe prodigies are in the A class with reclining seats complete with air conditioning, but Akihisa is in F class, the lowest rung of the school ladder which is furnished only with low, decrepit tables and worn-out straw tatami mats. A girl named Mizuki Himeji is actually one of the smartest girls in Akihisa\u2019s sophomore year, but she had a fever on test day and was pigeonholed into the F class. Besides Mizuki (who Akihisa secretly adores), the F class also has Y?ji Sakamoto, the class president who has been Akihisa\u2019s friend and partner-in-crime since the freshman year.",
