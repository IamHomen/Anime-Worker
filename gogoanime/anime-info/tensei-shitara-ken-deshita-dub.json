When the sword comes upon a forest filled with monsters, he meets a young girl fleeing from a beast. Grabbing the sword, the girl easily defeats the monster. After introducing herself as Fran, she names the sword \"Shishou\" and officially becomes his wielder.\r\n\r\nThe two set out to become adventurers, but unfortunately for Fran, she is a member of the Black Cat Tribe\u2014a Beastkin group with a bad reputation.
