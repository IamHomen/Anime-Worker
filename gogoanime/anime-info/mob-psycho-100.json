He could bend spoons and lift objects with his mind from a young age, but he slowly began to withhold from using his abilities in public due to the negative attention he kept receiving. Now, the only thing he wants is to become friends with a girl in his class, Tsubomi. With his psychic \"mentor\" (who has no psychic powers), he continues his daily life, attempting to realize his purpose in life.",
