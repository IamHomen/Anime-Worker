As a result, gigantic gates appeared, leading to dungeons abundant in \"kirakuri,\" crystals containing the energy needed for the foundation of the world. This led to the formation of various companies of adventurers who would harvest kirakuri from the dungeons.\r\n\r\nFollowing his father's disappearance inside one of the biggest gates in Gatepia, Minato is urged by his childhood friend Yutoria to become the president of his father's treasure-hunting company\u2014the Kibou Company.
