With only an enigmatic \"Servant\" by his side, Hakuno Kishinami will have to face both friends and foes in battles to the death in order to not only gain possession of a mysterious object known as the \"Holy Grail,\" but also to find the answer to the most important question of all: \"Who am I?\"",
