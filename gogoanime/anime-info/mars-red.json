But now, the number of vampires is increasing and a mysterious, artificial blood source called Ascra has appeared.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese government, in turn, creates \"Code Zero,\" an unit within the army tasked with taking down the vampiric forces. And what better way to track vampires than by using vampires?\r\n\r\nCreated by Lieutenant General Nakajima, this unit has historically been in the business of information war, but has been re-assigned to solve the vampire crisis.",
