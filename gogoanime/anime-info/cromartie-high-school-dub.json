  "synopsis": "Folks, meet Takashi Kamiyama. Enrolled at Cromartie High, where everybody is a delinquent, Kamiyama is apparently the only non-delinquent in the school. Logically, therefore, he must be the toughest in his class - by the rather twisted logic that only a really tough rabbit would lie down with lions. Thus begins a story that parodies every clich\u00e9 of tough-guy anime that you've ever heard of, and some you haven't. Oh, and Freddie Mercury is in it, too.",
