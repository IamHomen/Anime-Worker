But after he passed away, seeing those photographs only served as a reminder of her loss, so she locked them away to be forgotten. Years later, her brother Kou finds their father\u2019s picture album, and as he flips through its pages, the pictures remind Fuu of all the happy memories of her father that she will carry with her forever.\r\n\r\nNow, as the shy Fuu enters her first year of high school, she once again takes up her father\u2019s old camera, determined to take wonderful pictures that will bring joy and happiness to others.",
