With only a murky recollection of what happened right before he logged in, he starts to wander around, searching for clues.\r\n\r\nHe comes upon an enormous, pitch dark tree (the Gigas Cedar), where he encounters a boy. \"My name is Eugeo. Nice to meet you, Kirito.\" Although he is supposedly a resident of the virtual world \u2013 an NPC \u2013 the boy shows the same array of emotions as any human being.\r\n\r\nAs Kirito bonds with Eugeo, he continues to search for a way to log out of this world.

A memory that he should not have in the first place.\r\n\r\nAnd in this memory, he sees someone other than Eugeo, a young blond girl. Her name is Alice. And it is a name that must never be forgotten...",
