  "synopsis": "In a world of immortal cultivation full of murderous intentions, Su Jin abides by the code of Taoism, practices steadily, and stays away from disasters until he unlocks the ability to travel through different worlds. Martial arts are prosperous in another world, right? I have the immortal method to reduce the dimension and strike, sweeping everything, opening up the harem, plundering the world's treasures and turning them to be the nutrition for my own cultivation! I am selfish, greedy for money and lustful, and occasionally kill people and set fires, but I am a good immortal",
