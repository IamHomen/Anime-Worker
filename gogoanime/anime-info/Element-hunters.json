  "synopsis": "In 2029, a large scale ground sinkage occurred in the Mediterranean Sea. Chemical elements such as oxygen, carbon, gold, molybdenum, and cobalt disappeared from the earth's crust suddenly. The human population was decreased by 90% in sixty years. Researchers found out that the disappeared elements were drained into a planet\u00a0Nega Earth, located in another dimension. To save the Earth, a special team called the\u00a0Element Hunters\u00a0is organized. All of the members are under 13 years old, because young and flexible brains are needed to access\u00a0Nega Earth.",
