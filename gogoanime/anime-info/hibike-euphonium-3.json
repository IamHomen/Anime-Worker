  "synopsis": "After the Kitauji High School Wind Ensemble pulls a stunning performance in Oumae Kumiko's first year, their results in her second year feel underwhelming to the entire club. They intended to achieve a gold medal at the national competition, but their participation ends with what is known as a \"dud gold\" at the Kansai competition: a gold medal that does not include being chosen to advance to the national competition. With the end of the cycle, the ensemble's seniors retire, and a new leadership takes charge; Kumiko, soon to be a senior herself, is appointed the new club president. Now it is up to her to, under the guidance of their teacher Taki Noboru, shoulder Kitauji to the Nationals once again and help the band achieve the gold medal they have been aiming for.",
