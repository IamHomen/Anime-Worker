Each of the five shorts was running on the lobby monitors in T-Joy's theater chain for two weeks before being replaced by the next short. In Tokyo's Shinjuku Wald 9 cinema complex the shorts were run on the complex's actual theater screens. They were then included in the Peeping Life: The Perfect Emotion's DVD release.",
