Montblanc's popularity only grew in the years following the war, thanks to his dedication to nature conservation and his loving personality.\r\n\r\nOnce a fellow war veteran, robotic Europol detective Gesicht is sent to investigate Montblanc's tragic demise. In his pursuit, Gesicht uncovers evidence of a mysterious entity known only as \"Pluto.\" He also learns of a conspiratorial plot to dismantle the eight specialized robots from around the world who participated in the war. Racing against time to save those who still remain, Gesicht grapples with his memory, morality, and a world full of hate, desperately attempting to defend the fragile coexistence of man and machine.",
