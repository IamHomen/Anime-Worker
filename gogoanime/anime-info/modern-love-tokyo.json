  "synopsis": "The story is about Tamami, who cannot say what she wants to say, and her sweet and sour memories of her school days with Rin, whom she cared for in her heart but is now estranged from. Yamada says, \"I hope it will be a story that will gradually light up your heart. I was a little nervous because this is the only anime episode, but I would be glad if you will enjoy it without any barriers as a form of story dealing with the common theme of 'love'.\"",
