  "synopsis": "In the vast and boundless world of immortals, the culture of cultivating immortals prevails, and mortals are proud to become monks. College student Lu Hangzhi traveled from modern times and became a mortal servant in Ziyun Town. He lived a life of walking on thin ice every day, but he refused to accept his fate and worked hard to get rid of the status quo and strive to get ahead. Later, because of a good deed, he was appreciated by Zhu Fuqin, the eldest lady of the Zhu Mansion, and his senior brother Leng Wuya, and was recruited into the Zhu Mansion to take the test. If he passed, he would have the opportunity to become a monk in Xuanxin Sect. Lu Hangzhi seized the opportunity to work hard and conscientiously completed all the tasks assigned by Zhu Fuqin. During this period, he occasionally got an unexpected opportunity. With the help of the five hundred-year-old spiritual fruit, he improved his qualifications and was highly valued by Zhu Fuqin. Zhu Fuqin felt that introducing Lu Hangzhi to Xuanxin Sect could increase his help, so he gave him many helping hands to help him grow quickly. Lu Hangzhi did not disappoint. Through unremitting efforts, he finally passed the test and became an outer disciple of Xuanxin Sect. However, this is just the beginning. Lu Hangzhi\u2019s ambition goes far beyond this. He wants to go further. Only by being promoted to an inner disciple can he obtain more resources and ensure that he has enough strength to gain a foothold.",
