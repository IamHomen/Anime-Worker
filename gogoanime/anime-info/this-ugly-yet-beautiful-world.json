What he had found was a beautiful girl coming out from a glowing cocoon, calling herself \u201cHikari.\u201d While Takeru was quite embarrassed because of Hikari\u2019s nudity, a strange monster suddenly showed up and immediately attacked the two. Both Takeru and Hikari demonstrated the power of their other selves before Takeru had a clue of what\u2019s going on. Ryou and Takeru are typical high school students.\nThat is, until Takeru finds an alien calling herself Hikari.

Takeru is a typical high school student until he saves Hikari, an alien girl with no memory of her past. Committing himself to take care of her, Takeru\u2019s life is suddenly filled with aliens and monsters.",
