  "synopsis": "Ranma 1/2 revolves around a 16-year old boy named Ranma Saotome who was trained from early childhood in martial arts. As a result of an accident during a training journey, he is cursed to become a girl when splashed with cold water, but hot water will change him back into a boy. Don\u2019t let the animation discourage you it was made a long time ago so let it slide. This show is very fun to watch and the first anime I ever finished that was over 100 episodes. I highly recommend this for those who want to see something while waiting for another show. Ranma 1/2 is very random and ecchi.",
