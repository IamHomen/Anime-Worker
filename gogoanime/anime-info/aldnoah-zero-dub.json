Upon landing, astronauts discovered an enchanted utility later referred to as \"Aldnoah,\" giving the astronauts a status of superiority. Soon, many humans have relocated to Mars, and have adapted to the name \"Martians.\" After Princess Asseylum, a royal Martian princess, descends onto Earth in an attempt to create a treaty between both planets, a war breaks out between Earth and Mars, and Martian soldiers begin to descend from the sky, riding steel giants, intent on exterminating humanity.",
