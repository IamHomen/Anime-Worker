  "synopsis": "Just as I entered the novel's world, I unexpectedly became the cannon fodder male character Mo Yaolang, and even married the villain BOSS as my wife? As cannon fodder, not only do I have to redeem my villainous wife to prevent her from turning evil, but I also have to seize the protagonist's fate. Mo Yaolang smiled faintly. Although I have no cultivation, the system has given me an endless supply of item cards and rare treasures, enough to stand at the pinnacle of this continent. The so-called 'child of destiny' is nothing more than an ant that can be crushed in the palm of my hand!",
