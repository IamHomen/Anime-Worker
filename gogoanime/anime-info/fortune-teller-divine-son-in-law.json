  "synopsis": "Chen Kaiwen, who is proficient in Qimen Dunjia (a form of ancient Chinese divination and metaphysical study), has completed his training. His master also set three rules for him. The first, do not compromise; the second, do not marry; the third, do not enter Fengming Mountain. However, by a twist of fate, Chen Kaiwen breaks all three rules, thus falling into various crises. The first challenge he encounters comes from the female lead, Bai Hui. When Bai Hui first met Chen Kaiwen, she was already engaged to the local corrupt businessman, Sun Qiang, but she was often plagued by nightmares. Therefore, she called upon Chen Kaiwen to break them. During the process, Chen Kaiwen discovered more and more secrets behind Sun Qiang.",
