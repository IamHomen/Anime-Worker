In order to defend against the onslaught of these beasts, everyone undergoes class transfers and crazily levels up. On the day of his transfer, Lu Fan becomes a hidden class - Dragon Tamer. However, due to the immense strength of dragons, it is deemed impossible for anyone to tame them, earning Dragon Tamer the reputation of being the most useless class.
