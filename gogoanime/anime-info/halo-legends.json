  "synopsis": "This particular segment from Halo Legends appears to focus on the relationship between a squad of elite Orbital Drop Shock Troopers and the even more elite Spartan soldier that\u2019s paired up with them. Once the action picks up \u2014 contrary to what you probably expect from the Halo franchise at this point \u2014 there isn\u2019t really a lot of gunplay; in fact, there are way more punches thrown than bullets fired. Sure, the games are all about shooting at brightly-colored aliens, but what Halo fan wouldn\u2019t want to see a Spartan take on a towering Brute in hand-to-hand combat?",
