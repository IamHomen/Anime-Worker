  "synopsis": "Life is but a dream. Or is it? How do you know if you're awake, or just dreaming that you're awake? This may sound like a silly question - unless you're a student at Tomobiki High School!Something strange, stranger than usual, is happening at Tomobiki High School, but with wacky classmates like Lum (a beautiful alien princess with a \"shocking\" personality), Ataru (the lecherous loser she loves), and Mendou (the suave scion of the wealthiest family on Earth), anything can happen! When Ataru, Lum, Mendou, and the rest of the gang discover that they've been reliving the \"day before the School Festival\" over and over again, they may be confused, but they aren't suprised! But things are getting worse, and if they don't find a way to break the chain, they'll be trapped forever.",
