Its inhabitants partake the journey to migrate back to Earth.\r\n\r\nAttempting to regenerate the Earth to make it hospitable, the migrants come up with a \"Zi-Forming\" scheme.\r\n\r\nHowever, the plan fails and Earth is left in its state of turmoil. Overrun by Zoids and blanked by unstable weather phenomena, the migrants are faced with a difficult life. The Empire and Republic settlements attempt to uncover Zoids buried within the Earth to bolster their respective armies.\r\n\r\nThe story picks up following second-generation Earth citizens: Leo Conrad and Buzz Cunningham, who have a chance encounter with a girl Sally Land as she flees the clutches of the Empire.",
