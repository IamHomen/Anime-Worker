A robot to grant three wishes, a robot to help you write your diary, a robot that intentionally misbehaves in order to keep its master from becoming bored\u2026 the robots are each built for a very specific purpose, and can\u2019t really do much of anything else. Luckily for mankind, however, these robots are much more useful than they appear to be at first glance\u2026 most of the time, anyway.",
