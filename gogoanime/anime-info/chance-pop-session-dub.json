Her three greatest followers are a varied bunch: religious Akari who loves to sing at her church, independent and self-sufficient Yuki, and the rich and snobby Nozomi. By chance, or possibly fate, the three finally meet at one of Reika's concerts, not knowing of the path they will soon be traveling together. They are so inspired by Reika's performance, that they all enroll in the Akiba music school and endeavor to become pop idols themselves. With friendships and hardships in the future, can the girls manage to succeed on the path they will choose?",
