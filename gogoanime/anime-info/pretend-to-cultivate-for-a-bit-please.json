  "synopsis": "Ye Fan has encountered his 100th transmigration and his 100th system. However, having had enough of intense competition, he has no plans to cultivate. Instead, he desires a peaceful, lazy life\u2014sleeping in, fishing, and improving his cooking skills every day. His fellow disciples, who constantly strive in their cultivation, regard him as a talentless waste, merely squandering the sect's resources and the innate gifts of his celestial physique. They all look down on him, and even the system itself feels like it's about to break down.",
