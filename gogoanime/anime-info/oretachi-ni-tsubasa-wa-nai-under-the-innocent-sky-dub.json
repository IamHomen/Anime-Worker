One of these is Kobato, his awkward younger sister. The other is Watarai Asuka, his negligent girlfriend.\r\n\r\nChitose Shuusuke is a poor freeloader. He passes his days working at various part-time jobs. One day, he has a disastrous first encounter with Tamaizumi Hiyoko. The next time they meet, Shuusuke discovers that they are fellow employees at his part-time job.\r\n\r\nNarita Hayato sees himself as a \"hard-boiled\" person. Back-breaking jobs are nothing to him. Hayato shuns normal human contact, but, during the nights, he would get together with delinquents and other denizens of the night. One such night, he meets the cheerful and oblivious Otori Naru.\r\n\r\nThe relationships with these girls will greatly affect these 3 young men. But what, exactly, is the relationship these young men have with each other?",
