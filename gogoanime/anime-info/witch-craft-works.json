  "synopsis": "Takamiya Honoka is a regular student whose only problem seems to be that he sits next to Kagari Ayaka, the school\u2019s #1 beauty. They have never spoken to each other before and any small interaction between them immediately results in her fanclub beating him. Yet when a falling part of the school\u2019s building is about to send him to the afterlife, it\u2019s Kagari that comes to his rescue. Only\u2026 she\u2019s dressed as a witch, carrying him in her arms and floating on a broom?! Kagari tells him it is her mission to protect him and that now she can finally protect him openly rather than undercover.",
