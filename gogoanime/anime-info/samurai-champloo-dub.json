These two fiercely independent warriors can`t be any more different from one another, yet their paths cross when Fuu, a ditzy waitress, saves them from being executed when they are arrested after a violent swordfight. Fuu convinces the two vagrant young men to help her find a mysterious samurai \"who smells of sunflowers.\" And their journey begins. This is a story about love, friendship and courage... NOT!",
