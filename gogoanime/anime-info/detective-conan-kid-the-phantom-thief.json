He vows to prevent the organization from gaining immortality, and assumes his father\u2019s identity as he begins his quest for the gem. His only clues as to the gem\u2019s location are that it glows red under the full moon and that it is a doublet: a gem hidden within a larger gem. Thus, it would have to be a relatively large one with a bizarre history, and always stored in a place that never receives moonlight. He thus researches and steals famous priceless gems with odd histories from incredibly well-defended areas, and always returns them after the very next full moon.",
