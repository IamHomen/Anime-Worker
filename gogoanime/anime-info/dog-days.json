On arrival in this fantastic world, Cinque, quickly takes on the role of a successful hero. There is a downside to all this though: Once summoned, a return to the hero's world of origin is no longer possible, as the disclaimer in tiny alien writing on the magic circle explains, that\u00a0Tatsumaki\u00a0used to teleport Cinque to this world. The temporary fun-packed visit to this strange land, has become quite permanent as it seems.Will Cinque be able to cope with all the adventures of this new reality?",
