However, his conscience prevents him from retiring at present, as he worries about the guild's future without him.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally\u2014as if to help him find his successor\u2014the guild's receptionist, Enome, assigns Kikuru four fresh recruits: the energetic beastwoman Hitamu \"Hitamuki\" Kyan, the prodigy Maidena Ange, the laid-back Toxico Dannar, and the stalwart Hanabata Nohkins. Although each of them possesses significant talents, they also display characteristics that detract from their potential\u2014including Hitamu's extreme clumsiness and Hanabata's unintentional perverseness.\r\n\r\nAs if there was not enough to deal with, the monsters outside Mebuki's walls start exhibiting odd behavior by targeting women salaciously, causing the party endless problems in more ways than one. Nevertheless, Kikuru is committed to retiring early; to achieve his goal, the guidance he gives the trainees will be absolutely essential.",
