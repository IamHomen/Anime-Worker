She is not very welcomed (specially at the start by her stepsister Sara), but after some time they are all a happy family. Rin (Lynn) is also very interested in horses and racing, and she wins a nice share of contests.\r\n\r\nThis series is divided into two parts, first with Rin being really a child, and the second with her being around 13.",
