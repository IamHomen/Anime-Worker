She is soon turned away however. Determined to get on the island, Tia searches for a way past the fences that guard the entrance, as another stranger arrives on the island to take on a mysterious job. Someone has been killing the inhabitants of the island and has the ability to appear and disappear at will.

But the sword has the ability to possess the person who wields it - putting Tia and the stranger at a great disadvantage.\r\n\r\nBased on the manga by Kohime Ohse, Tia and Grandeek will have to face their most difficult challenge yet...",
