Fifteen years later, he, Lin Yi, the son of the massacred family, has ascended to become a god of killing and returned to seek revenge. He vowed to uncover the truth behind the massacre and make the masterminds pay with blood. Disguised as the \u201cwastrel\u201d of the Lin family in the eyes of the world, he set out to investigate the truth, only to be publicly rejected by his childhood sweetheart, a celebrity female CEO, and ridiculed by the powerful elites. However, to everyone\u2019s surprise, just as he was being rejected, a wealthy heiress came forward, pursuing him and proposing marriage. From that moment on, he decided not to live for others anymore, but for himself. He would use his strength to slap everyone in the face, uncover the truth behind the massacre, and reclaim his place at the pinnacle of life.",
