Qin Huai gave in and became a 007 wage earner in another world, earning points day and night, and of course the result was really fragrant! Divine soldiers, treasures, peerless exercises, and gentle and lovely little junior sisters, all came to their arms! What is the daily life of Zongmen?\r\n\r\nOf course, it's a salted fish on the surface, and a volume king behind the scenes. The upgrade speed catches up with everyone, and one accident can save the whole sect!

Let's see how the young man grasps the system and dominates the other world!",
