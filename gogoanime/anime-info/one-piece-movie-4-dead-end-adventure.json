On the night before the race they happen to make contact with Gasparde, an ex-Marine that is feared by other pirates and hated by the Marine; his gang; and Shuraiya Bascud, a headhunter that is more than he seems at first.After the night is over, the morning arrives and thus the beginning of their new\u00a0Dead End Adventure.",
