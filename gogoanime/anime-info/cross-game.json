One of the regular customers of his family\u2019s store is the Tsukishima Batting Center, and so he gets to know the four daughters of the Tsukishima family (Ichiyo, Wakaba, Aoba, and Momiji) very well. Since Koh has spent so much time practicing in their batting cages, he has become a genius hitter, but has no knowledge of any other aspect of baseball.

As he finally begins playing again, it remains to be seen whether or not he will live up to the expectations of those who know the true talent he has been hiding all this time.",
