They decide to start up their own band; \"Lucifer, The Fallen Angel\". The problem is, they have a serious lack of available talent.\n Meanwhile, across town, an extraordinarily talented piano player and singer has shown up at a hotel, and is thrilling audiences with his amazing style and grace. He's a quiet, soft-spoken man, however, and is obviously harbouring dark secrets as well as suffering from depression.\u00a0Lucifer\u00a0needs a vocalist; this mysterious stranger needs a path in life. Will they find each other?",
