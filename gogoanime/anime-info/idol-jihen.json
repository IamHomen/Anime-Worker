It\u2019s in this situation, with Japan cornered with no way out, that idols rise up to save the day!\r\n\r\nThe Heroine Party, Sunlight Party, Starlight Party, Bishoujo Party, Wakaba Party, Subculture New Party, and SOS Party. From these seven idol political parties, the idols who have become National Diet members and representatives for each prefecture will smash through the sense of stagnation covering Japan using the power of song and dance! They\u2019ll bring back the smiling faces of the people, and wrap Japan in a glittering aura!!",
