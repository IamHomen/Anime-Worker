  "synopsis": "Our heroine Mari is an innocent, boy-shy, devoutly Christian young girl who's just entered a religious high school. When her best friend is kidnapped by a mysterious cult, Mari prays to the Virgin Mary for help. Instead, the Buddha shows up and tells her that she's going to be a magical girl.\nBut not just any magical girl, mind you...none of this fuku-wearing, pink-wand-waving crap. She is presented with a sumo-style loincloth (magical, of course) and instructed to go kick bad guy butt. Being a good little Christian girl, the Buddha has to talk Mari into it, but she grudgingly agrees to bare her ass for the sake of her friend. And so Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gotaman was born! Villains beware her mighty ass of justice! Wedgies only make her stronger! Not even Darth Veda sumo can withstand her mighty posterior!",
