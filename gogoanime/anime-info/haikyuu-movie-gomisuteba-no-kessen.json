  "synopsis": "Kenma Kozume has never considered volleyball fun or thrilling: it is merely something he is good at. But now Nekoma High School's volleyball team has qualified for the Spring Nationals and prepares to battle their long-standing rivals\u2014Karasuno. Now, Kenma has to analyze the most confounding and resilient team and lead Nekoma to victory against them. Moreover, he will play against his friend Shouyou Hinata, Karasuno's short but incredibly proficient middle blocker.\r\n\r\nKarasuno has never been able to beat Nekoma in practice matches. Even so, despite his usual indifference, Kenma feels a tinge of excitement at the prospect of facing Karasuno in a high-stakes official game with no do-overs. To advance to the semifinals and ultimately restore their team's former glory, Karasuno must find a way to overcome Kenma's brilliant strategy and defeat Nekoma in their own territory.",
