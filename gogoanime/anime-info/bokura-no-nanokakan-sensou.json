In fact, they were hiding in an abandoned factory near the river, and used it as a liberation area to rebel against the adults. The adults are in great confusion by the huge and unexpected operations cooperated by the female students; entangled with real abduction cases, a corrupted mayor election, and even involving parents and television reporters who are thrilled by the liberation broadcast and barricade.
