  "synopsis": "Satou Tatsuhiro, a 22 year old young man, is a NEET (Not in Employment, Education, or Training) and a hikikomori (meaning acute social withdrawal). He believes everything around him is a conspiracy, including the reason why many people, himself included, become hikikomori.\nDue to this, Satou creates a strange conspiracy theory which includes the Nihon Hikikomori Ky?kai (NHK), a secret organization with the intention of producing a hikikomori filled world. Satou intends to break free from the NHK\u2019s clutches, but cannot, since he finds it too frightening to go outdoors by himself; that is, until he meets Misaki Nakahara, who selects Satou for her \u201cproject\u201d that she claims will cure him of his hikikomori ways.",
