The only survivors are a technological society in a magnificent enclosed scientifically-designed refuge city, Ecoban, and a small horde of refugees in the Wasteland just outside. The leaders of Ecoban have supported the refugees in return for their providing labor to mine the raw materials needed to keep Ecoban operational. \r\n\r\nAfter a century, Ecoban\u2019s leaders have degenerated into an indolent elite class who have reduced the \u201cDiggers\u201d to slavery, providing no more than the barest minimum to keep them alive. Meanwhile, the machinery sustaining Ecoban continues to pollute the world outside. The Diggers have finally grown angry enough to strike for better conditions. At the same time Ecoban\u2019s machinery is breaking down and repairing it requires endangering the \"Diggers\" lives with more pollution.",
