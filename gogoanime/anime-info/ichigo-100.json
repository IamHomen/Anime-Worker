Junpei returns the notebook to the student whose name is listed in it, to\u00a0Toujou Aya, but he is disappointed to find out that she is not the girl that he met on the rooftop.\n On a dare from his friends, he decides to confess to most beautiful girl in 3rd year class,\u00a0Nishino Tsukasa. While her hairstyle is different from the girl of his dreams, she is both very beautiful and she was wearing strawberry panties, so she must have been the girl that he met on the rooftop, or was she?",
