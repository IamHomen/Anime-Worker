But before she is officially crowned as queen, she must restore balance to the universe that has come to favor darkness.

She also appoints the rabbit-like creature Ryou-Ouki to aid Sasami in the battle against evil.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sasami refuses to become a magical girl\u2014not because she is scared, but because she finds it too embarrassing! Meanwhile, the arrogant Ramia is plotting to overthrow Tsunami by enlisting her own magical girl\u2014the eccentric Pixy Misa\u2014to cause chaos and ensure that balance is never restored. As Pixy Misa terrorizes the planet with her Love-Love monsters, Sasami must learn to swallow her pride and accept her role as the universe's champion of justice, Pretty Sammy.",
