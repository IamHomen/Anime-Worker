  "synopsis": "Although admired at school for her amiability and academic prowess, high school student Kyouko Hori has been hiding another side of her. With her parents often away from home due to work, Hori has to look after her younger brother and do the housework, leaving no chance to socialize away from school.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Izumi Miyamura is seen as a brooding, glasses-wearing otaku. However, in reality, he is a gentle person inept at studying. Furthermore, he has nine piercings hidden behind his long hair and a tattoo along his back and left shoulder.\r\n\r\nBy sheer chance, Hori and Miyamura cross paths outside of school\u2014neither looking as the other expects. These seemingly polar opposites become friends, sharing with each other a side they have never shown to anyone else.",
