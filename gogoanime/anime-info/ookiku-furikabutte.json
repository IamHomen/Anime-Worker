  "synopsis": "Mihashi Ren is the quirky ace pitcher of Nishiura high school's newly formed baseball team. He, however, has hit rock-bottom in terms of confidence and self-belief, thanks to a traumatic three years in his middle school - Mihoshi academy - and switched to Nishiura just to get away from it all. The team's catcher, Abe Takaya, thinks otherwise and believes that Mihashi has the control and skill required, and with his lead, could take them all the way to Koshien.Guided by an enterprising coach and an innovative mentor, the team slowly gel as a unit and train hard to make a mark in the upcoming summer tournament.",
