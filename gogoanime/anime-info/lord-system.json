  "synopsis": "To become the ultimate game character, you must meet three conditions: gain access to the game's \"Lord System\" control panel, take over the body of a noble family's illegitimate son, and make sure nobody else knows they're in a game. Well, Richard Orlando fulfills them all! Now he must build an army and fight through goblins, gnolls, trolls, and more to discover new lands, all while keeping the Lord System a secret. But with that trump card on his side, it'll only be a matter of time before he conquers all and becomes the ultimate Lord of the new realm!",
