However, one day, he woke up thinking, \"I am not really fit to be together with someone as good as her, huh...\" Upon realizing this, Wataru started keeping an appropriate distance from her, much to Aika's surprise. \"Could it be that he hates me now...?\"\r\n\r\nDid his intentions slip by her because she was getting impatient after arriving at the wrong conclusion?! This is the start of a romcom revolving around two people who just can't get their feelings across and both think their love is unrequited!",
