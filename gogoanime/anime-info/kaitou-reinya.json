Tanaka Reina, a member of Hello Project's girl band Morning Musume, serves as the inspiration for the main character Reinya, a thief that is the stuff of urban legends.\nTanaka (Onegai My Melody Kirara's title character) will play Reinya, a girl who wears a signboard for the Faminya convenience store near a police station by day. By night, she is a whimsical thief chased by bumbling police officers, led by the handsome Keiji-san (\"Detective,\" Okano Kousuke) and the cool Keibu-san (\"Inspector,\" Youki Sou). Joining Reinya on her escapades is her trusty assistant, the mouse Chuutarou (Okano).",
