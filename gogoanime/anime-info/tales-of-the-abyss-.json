Now Luke\u2019s memory of the life he led before is missing, and a strange voice, which only he can hear, has been calling out to him ever since.\nOne day while training with his mentor, Van Grants, a strange woman called Tear breaks into the mansion with the sole intent of taking Van\u2019s life. During the struggle Luke is transported far from home, along with Tear, and now that Luke has finally gained the freedom he\u2019s been dreaming of, what awaits him in the outside world will shatter everything he\u2019s ever known about himself.",
