  "synopsis": "In the year 0079 of the Universal Century, the Principality of Zeon declares independence from the Earth Federation, plunging the two nations into war. Thanks to a revolutionary new weapon known as a Mobile Suit, the Zeon Force initially gains the upper hand. However, they lacked the power to take control of the entire Earth, bringing the war to a stalemate.\r\n\r\nEleven months into the war, the Earth Federation forces manage to seize a Zeon-controlled base located in Eastern Europe. Among the mixed battalion headed to reclaim this base is Sorari and the Red Wolves division, a Mobile Suit platoon that has just descended from space.",
