Joey has always wanted to become a hero. Unfortunately he\u2019s just an orphan working part time to support his grandma and himself. After he watches a toy commercial about a new robot action figure, Joey believes he\u2019ll gain strength if he obtains one. The only robot toy he can get his hands on is a broken one that was abandoned by a rich school bully.\nFeeling pity for the trashed action figure, Joey takes it home to repair it; little did he know that once he repairs the toy, it\u2019ll make his hero dream become a reality.",
