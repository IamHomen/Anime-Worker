However, his focus soon changes as he becomes curious about a golden strand of hair on the stairs. The steps lead him to a large garden and a beautiful doll-like girl known as Victorique de Blois, whose complex and imaginative foresight allows her to predict their futures, now intertwined.\r\n\r\nWith more mysteries quickly developing\u2014including the appearance of a ghost ship and an alchemist with the power of transmutation\u2014Victorique and Kujou, bound by fate and their unique skills, have no choice but to rely on each other.",
