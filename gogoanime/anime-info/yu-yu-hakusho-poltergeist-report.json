Ultimately, the Netherworld was destroyed and Lord Yakumo, the King of the Netherworld, was banished to the depths of space. Now, five defenders from the Spirit World must team-up against Yakumo's Demon-Gods for possesion of five, mystical sites. But Lord Yakumo is dangerously close to reclaiming the Power Sphere - the source of the Netherworld's energy - and once it is again in his possession, our world will become the new Netherworld.",
