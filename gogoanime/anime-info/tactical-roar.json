Shipping and navigation became important to nations and followed by the specter of ocean pirates thus necessisating companies to hire escort cruisers to safeguard their investments. Hyousuke Nagimiya is a system engineer that was comissioned to upgrade the Pascal Magi manned by an entire crew of women with its captain, Misaki Nanaha. Together the crew strives to prove themselves to their detractors that they are no mere \u2018Alice Brand\u2019.\nYet as they go about their mission a larger global conspiracy seems to be working behind the scenes to take advantage of this new world order.",
