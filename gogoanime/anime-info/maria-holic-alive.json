  "synopsis": "Plot Summary:Some things never change: Ame no Kisaki, that famous and extraordinarily exclusive boarding school, STILL doesn\u2019t accept boys. And Kanako, Kisaki\u2019s most romantically unfortunate student, STILL doesn\u2019t accept them either. They give her the hives. Literally. Sadly, that means that Kanako\u2019s STILL trying to connect with ANYONE of the same sex\n, and having the usual horrid luck; STILL being in imminent peril of dying from the constant nosebleeds she gets from being over stimulated by the presence of her fellow classmates; and STILL being forced to endure the tragedy of sharing a room with the school\u2019s most beautiful girl, who is, of course, STILL a guy in drag. Poor Kanako! She came to school to major in loving women, and instead she\u2019s STILL failing relationships in Maria Holic Alive!",
