He is concerned that his new boss will also use power harassment to make his life miserable. Momose tries to hide his concern about facing a similar situation with his new boss, Shirasaki. To Momose's surprise, however, Shirasaki's inherent airheadedness immediately alleviates all of his concerns, giving him a sense of relief.",
