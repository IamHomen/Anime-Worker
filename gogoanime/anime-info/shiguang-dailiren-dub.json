In a small shop called \"Time Photo Studio,\" the two friends provide a special service: using their extraordinary powers that let them enter photographs, they jump into pictures brought to them by clients in order to grant their wishes. Through the eyes of the photographer, they live through the events surrounding the picture and try to decipher how to solve their client's request.\r\n\r\nBut every time they jump into a picture, they take a great risk.
