Mariya threatens to expose Kanako's impure intentions unless she keeps his real gender a secret, and to make things worse, he also replaces her original roommate so that he can now keep a close eye on her.\r\n\r\nMaria\u2020Holic follows Kanako as she looks for love in all the wrong places and searches for the girl of her dreams\u2014that is, if she can survive being Mariya's roommate!\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
