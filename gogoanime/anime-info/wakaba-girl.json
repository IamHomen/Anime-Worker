  "synopsis": "The story centers around the activities of Wakaba Kohashi, \"a slightly out-of-tune super\" daughter of a well-to-do family, and her friends. Wakaba (literally, \"young leaves\") looks like an elegant rich daughter, but she admires the trendy gyaru fashion subculture. There is also the pure, innocent, fairy-tale-like Moeko. Mao is capricious and behaves in her own way. Nao used to be an athletic type of girl, but now loves the boys-love genre.",
