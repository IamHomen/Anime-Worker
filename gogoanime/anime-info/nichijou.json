  "synopsis": "While the title suggests a story of simple, everyday school life, the contents are more the opposite. The setting is a strange school where you may see the principal wrestle a deer or a robot\u2019s arm hide a rollcake. However there are still normal stories, like making a card castle or taking a test you didn\u2019t study for.",
