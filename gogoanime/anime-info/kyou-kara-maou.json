  "synopsis": "Plot Summary:\u00a0Yuri Shibuya was living a pretty normal life. That changed the day he was dunked into a toilet after an attempt to save a classmate from a gang of bullies. Instead of just getting a good soaking, he\u2019s pulled in. The next thing he knows, he\u2019s in a world that vaguely resembles medieval Europe. If that\u2019s not odd enough, he\u2019s told that he is to be the next Maoh, just because he has black hair and black eyes. The Maoh is the King of the Mazoku,\nwho are coexisting not-so-peacefully with the humans in this world. Much to his subjects\u2019 dismay, he\u2019s totally different from the rulers they\u2019re accustomed to. He\u2019s kind, considerate, a believer in justice, and not willing to use violence to solve conflicts. Not exactly someone they want running a country on the very brink of war. Now, Yuri has to deal with trying to become a good Maoh, while at the same time attempting to adapt to this lands\u2019 customs and culture, all in a world where the tension between the humans and Mazoku is reaching its peak.",
