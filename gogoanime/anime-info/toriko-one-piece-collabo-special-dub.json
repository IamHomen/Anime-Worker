  "synopsis": "After being driven into an unknown part of the world\u2019s oceans, Sanji tells his friend Luffy the terrible news that there are no more food supplies on board. Fortunately, salvation is found on a nearby uninhabited island where meat literally grows on trees. But the island is not entirely deserted after all, for they soon meet the gourmet hunter Toriko. After munching their way through a herd of barbecued wild boars, the Straw Hats get back to work replenishing their supplies. But Toriko has the perfect solution for this: together, they hunt down the legendary Hungri-la bird. But when Nami and Komatsu are kidnapped by Cocoalas, (almost) nobody thinks about food anymore \u2026",
