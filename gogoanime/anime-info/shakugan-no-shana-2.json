  "synopsis": "Sakai Yuuji, a high school student who expected his normal life to last forever, is dead. When he was on his way home he witnessed a shocking view as the world suddenly froze: people were engulfed by blue flames and a monster resembling a large doll swallowed them. Just as the monster prepared to consume Yuuji, a sword-wielding girl in black attire with flaming red eyes and hair that burns like embers saved him from the monster. The girl called herself a \u201cFlame Haze\u201d who hunts the \u201cGuze no Tomogara\u201d, creatures from another world.\nAs Yuuji noticed a blue flame in his chest, she called him a \u201cTorch\u201d, a temporary replacement, saying that the \u201creal\u201d Yuuji\u2019s existence had already ended. Unfazed, Yuuji befriended the strange girl, named her \u201cShana\u201d, and joined her fight against Tomogara and other Flame Hazes.",
