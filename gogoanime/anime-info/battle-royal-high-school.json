To make matters worse, all the inter-dimensional commotion has attracted the attention of a sword-happy exorcist and the heroic Zankan of the Space-Time Police!\r\n\r\nWhich all means that Riki is about to take one bitch of a mid-term. The course is survival, and forget \"Pass/Fail\". The test is graded \"Live/Die\".",
