Having failed her university entry exams, she is far from spending another year at Ooarai, but her plight is unenviable nevertheless.\r\n\r\nThe only way for her to gain admission into a university is to be granted an athletic scholarship. With the Winter Continuous Track Cup rapidly approaching, Momo becomes the commander of Ooarai's tankery team, so as to demonstrate her sport skills and wipe away the stain on her honor.\r\n\r\nTheir first opponent\u2014French-themed BC Freedom High School\u2014is split into two factions that are constantly at odds with each other.
