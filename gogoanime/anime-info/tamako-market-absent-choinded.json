  "synopsis": "Tamako knows just about everything there is to know about mochi, the traditional Japanese dessert treats. When she\u2019s not attending her first year of high school, she even invents new flavors and varieties for Tama-ya, her family\u2019s mochi shop. School and growing up, on the other hand, are some things that she\u2019s still trying to find the right recipe for. But with the help of her best friends Kanna and Midori, two girls whose parents run businesses in the same shopping district, Tamako\u2019s determined to make the best of things.\nIt\u2019s complicated though, especially when it comes to emotions and her relationship with her best boy friend Mochizo, whose family runs a rival mochi shop. And lately, Kanna\u2019s been feeling a little odd about her feelings towards Tamako as well. And what\u2019s with up with that strange bird fluttering around, the one that speaks fluent Japanese? It\u2019s all very mysterious and overwhelming, but at least Tamako always has one thing she can count on: No matter if your day\u2019s been good or bad, there\u2019s certain to be something sugary and delicious waiting at the end of every adventure whenever you take a walk through Tamako Market!",
