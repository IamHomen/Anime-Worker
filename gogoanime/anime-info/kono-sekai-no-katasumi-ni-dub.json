  "synopsis": "Suzu Urano is a pure and kindhearted girl who loves to draw. She can also be quite the airhead, owing to her ceaseless daydreaming, much to the annoyance but also the joy of those close to her. Growing up in the outskirts of Hiroshima City, Japan, she led an ordinary but happy life with her family.\r\n\r\nHowever, after some time, Suzu has to suddenly leave her beloved home to move into the neighboring town of Kure, due to her marriage to Shuusaku Houjou, a man she barely knows. Put to work in her husband's household, the homesick girl struggles to adjust to the unfamiliar environment, living with a family who treats her coldly. She cannot help but question: can this ever truly become her new home?\r\n\r\nKono Sekai no Katasumi ni depicts the years from 1933 to the end of World War II, when peaceful everyday life gradually gives way to harsh and unforgiving conditions, as the war eventually reaches Japan's shores and Suzu's own backyard. She will have to prevail against the inevitable suffering and loss that accompanies war, all the while supporting herself and those she comes to love.",
