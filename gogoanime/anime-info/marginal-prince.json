  "synopsis": "Yuuto goes to a secret boy\u2019s school called the St. Alphonse Gakuin. There, he makes five (bishounen)friends, each of which seem to be the princes or royalty of rather unknown or marginal areas. Each episode, a character sings a rather interesting song, however, the plot is rather weak. There\u2019s a lot of eyecandy, and despite it\u2019s weak delivery, it\u2019s a bit amusing to watch.",
