That is until one fateful day, he was drawn into the Holy Grail War and had to summon a female \u201cServant\u201d known as Saber in order to protect himself. It turns out that the Holy Grail War involves a series of battles among powerful sorcerors to fight for the possession of a relic that will grant one\u2019s wishes, the Holy Grail. There are altogether seven \u201cMasters\u201d who can summon their respective \u201cServants\u201d from different classes known as Saber, Archer, Rider, Berserker, Lancer, Caster and Assasin. These \u201cServants\u201d have to hide their names in order not to reveal their weaknesses to the enemies. The story revolves around Shirou and his entanglement in the Holy Grail War.\nGenres: action, drama, fantasy, romance, supernatural Themes: harem, martial arts, war",
