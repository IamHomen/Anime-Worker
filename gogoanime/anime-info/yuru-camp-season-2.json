All goes according to plan until unforeseen weather blocks the roads back home, making a return trip impossible. Rin, who is now stranded for a few days, is invited by Nadeshiko Kagamihara to stay at her grandmother's house.\nWhat is supposed to be a two-day trip becomes an extended period of sightseeing and new experiences for Rin, and she encounters some new and old faces along the way. Yuru Camp\u25b3 Season 2 continues the story of Rin, Nadeshiko, and their friends as they further explore the joys of camping.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
