  "synopsis": "Bouida Haruto, a hardcore otaku with no interest in 3D (real) women, once appreciated figures from afar, accepting that \"if you get into them, there's no turning back.\" However, when Nona, a character he loved from an anime called \"Girls\u2192Planetary Investigation\" had a figure of her released, he ended up purchasing it. And then that night, the figure of Nona somehow came to life, and a couple-like lifestyle between man and toy began.",
