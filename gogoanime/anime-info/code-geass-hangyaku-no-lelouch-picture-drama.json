  "synopsis": "At Ashford Academy, the girls get into juicy talks in the bath, and later plan a gender role reversal festival, which has everyone but Lelouch Lamperouge eager. The students also attend the grand opening of the Clovis Land pool, much to the scantily clad Cornelia li Britannia's embarrassment. Events from Lelouch's past show a chapter from his royal upbringing, and how he met Suzaku Kururugi. Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch Picture Drama shows that when they are away from the bloodshed and agony of war, the characters live very different and often humorous lives.",
