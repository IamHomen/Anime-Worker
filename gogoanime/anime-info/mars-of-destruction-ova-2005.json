An organization called AAST is founded, which in cooperation with Structure Doctor Hiroshi Hyuga develops a suit, \"Mars\", as a trump card against the relic people. Whoever wears the suit obtains super powers, but only a few genetically compatible people are able to wear it. Tairu, the son of the doctor, was the first suitable person.One of the fallen fragments is being transported to a laboratory in the United States for an analysis when the transfer is intercepted by the relic people. Now Tairu has to fight and defend humanity's chance to bring an end to the incident.",
