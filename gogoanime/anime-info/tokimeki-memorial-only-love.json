  "synopsis": "Aoba Riku has just transferred to a new high school because of his father\u2019s job, and things aren\u2019t quite what he expected. The headmaster\u2019s secretary controls the school while espousing the virtues of academic freedom, the teachers are even stranger than normal teachers, and half the student body is walking around with animal ears on.\nOn his very first day, Riku is unfortunate enough to find himself at the center of the student council\u2019s latest event, which has him running for his life. All this on top of the normal high school rigour of popularity contests, crushes, and homework makes it unsure whether Riku will be able to survive this new school. Genres: comedy, drama, romance",
