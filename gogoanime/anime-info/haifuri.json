The setting is one such all-girls school. The girls who enroll here study to become blue mermaids through classroom instruction and learning practical skills. They live by the motto: In the sea we live, the sea we protect, and by the sea we go. They must excel in their studies and also adopt an international mindset. They are the Elite of the Sea, who are expected to be knowledgeable of the customs and cultures of other countries as well as their own.",
