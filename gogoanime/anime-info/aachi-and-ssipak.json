To reward production, people receive addictive, Popsicle-like\u00a0Juicybars.\u00a0Aachi\u00a0and\u00a0Ssipak\u00a0are street hoodlums who struggle to survive by trading black market Juicybars. Through a chain of events involving their porn-director acquaintance\u00a0Jimmy the Freak, they meet wannabe-actress\u00a0Beautiful, whose defecations are rewarded by exceptional quantities of Juicybars. For that reason, Beautiful is also wanted by the violent blue mutants known as the\u00a0Diaper Gang\u00a0(led by the\u00a0Diaper King), the police (most notably the cyborg police officer\u00a0Geko), and others.",
