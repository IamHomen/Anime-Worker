  "synopsis": "Torn apart by its long, brutal war with the\u00a0Republic of Frost, the\u00a0Royal Empire\u00a0can finally begin to rebuild. Faced with famine, plague, renegade soldiers, and corruption within its own government, the Empire is hard pressed to soothe its people and heal its wounds.\nFor this purpose, the\u00a0Imperial State Section III\u00a0has been formed for the purpose of war relief. Named\u00a0Pumpkin Scissors\u00a0by its 2nd Lieutenant, the noblewoman\u00a0Alice L. Malvin, the unit is considered a joke and criticized as a farce of the Empire to quell its peoples' complaints and squander funds.Regardless of its reputation as a\u00a0carefree\u00a0branch with its misfit members, the members of Pumpkin Scissors diligently work to relieve the war damage suffered by the people and root out the corruption that has taken hold, and truly be the\u00a0war relief\u00a0they were meant to be.During a mission three years after the unit was founded, Pumpkin Scissors stumble across a mysterious war veteran,\u00a0Randel Oland, who joins them, entranced with the concept of\u00a0war relief. It does not take long for other members of S.S. III to notice his peculiar blue lantern and heavy gun, and that the unit he says he belonged to in the war... does not exist.",
