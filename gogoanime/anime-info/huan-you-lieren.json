  "synopsis": "In 2079 the birth of the brainwave instrument BrainStation triggered the fourth industrial revolution. Mankind has ushered in a brand new era-the \"virtual cyber age\". Through the use of a BrainStation, people can connect to an all encompassing cyber world. This virtual world is constructed like a neural network and the entire system is controlled and dispatched by the master brain Watson.\r\n\r\nHowever, over time issues are starting to surface: many people can't distinguish between virtual and reality, leading to psychosis and long-term addiction to the virtual world.",
