  "synopsis": "Sasameki Koto is the story of Murasame Sumika, an intelligent and athletically gifted girl who just happens to be in love with her best friend, Kazama Ushio. Unable to confess her feelings, Sumika can only stay by her side and watch over her. After all, the biggest obstacle to her love is something that she can\u2019t change. It has nothing to do with the fact they\u2019re both girls; Sumika just isn\u2019t Kazama\u2019s type! Kazama is only into cute girls and Sumika\u2019s cool personality just doesn\u2019t fit the bill. Much to her friend\u2019s dismay, Kazama is always eager to share news about her latest crush. With the duo\u2019s knack for attracting trouble, it looks like Sumika\u2019s trials have only just begun. Gen",
