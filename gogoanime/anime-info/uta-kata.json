When Manatsu, a mysterious girl from inside the mirror, steps out and offers her friendship for the summer, she also offers Ichika magical powers.\nNow, Manatsu must help Ichika unlock the powers of the 12 Djinn in order to complete her magic training\u2026 but perhaps this is something that will prove too difficult a task. Some offers may appear too be good to be true and this one just may turn out to do more harm than good.",
