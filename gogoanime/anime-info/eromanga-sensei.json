Masamune's little sister is Sagiri, a shut-in girl who hasn't left her room for an entire year. She even forces her brother to make and bring her meals when she stomps the floor. Masamune wants his sister to leave her room, because the two of them are each other's only family.\r\n\r\nMasamune's novel illustrator, pen name \"Eromanga,\" draws extremely perverted drawings, and is very reliable.

To add to the chaos that erupts between the siblings, a beautiful, female, best-selling shoujo manga creator becomes their rival!",
