  "synopsis": "Take one group of rabid fan girls with tenuous grips on reality, toss out all rules of proper social behavior, mix them together in a basement with more twisted anime parodies and allusions than you can shake a schtick at, and what do you get? Well, besides a recipe for disaster, if borderline delusional\u00a0Todayama Kyouko\u00a0is in what passes for charge, you get the Asstronomical Club, where mayhem rules and the wall between the real world and total fantasy shatters at least once every five minutes!\nAnd as if things weren't wild enough, let's throw in a\u00a0boys love\u00a0manga fanatic\u00a0who always seems to end up in her underwear,\u00a0a maid on a secret mission,a ruthless arch-enemy\u00a0whose goal is to have the club disbanded, and a\u00a0cat\u00a0as the faculty adviser! And then there's\u00a0Itsuki, who still inexplicably thinks this is a club for astronomy... Although to be fair, some of the members\u00a0do\u00a0seem to be robots/aliens and/or from outer space. One thing's for certain though: the Student Council will most definitely\u00a0not\u00a0approve of what happens when the Insane-O-Meter redlines and freaky fan girls run wild in\u00a0Ebiten!",
