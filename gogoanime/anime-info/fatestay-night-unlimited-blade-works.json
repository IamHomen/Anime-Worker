Have withstood pain to create many weapons. Yet, those hands will never hold anything. So as I pray,\u00a0Unlimited Blade Works.\"\u00a0\u2014 from introEmiya Shirou\u00a0finds himself an unwilling participant in a deadly competition where seven\u00a0Mages\u00a0summon heroic spirits as servants to duel each other to the death. They compete for the chance to make a wish from theHoly Grail, which has the power to grant any wish.

However, problems arise between Shirou and Rin's servant,\u00a0Archer, who seems to despise him.",
