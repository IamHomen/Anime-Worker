  "synopsis": "The third of Tadao Nagahama's Romance Super Robot Trilogy. (#1: Chou Denji Robo Combattler V, #2: Chou Denji Machine Voltes V)\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of their homeworld, the survivors of the planet Barm head towards Earth with the goal of negotiating the purchase of land to emigrate to. Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Barmian\u2019s leader, Leon, is assassinated by his second in command, Olban, and the delegation from Earth is framed for the murder. In the ensuing chaos, Doctor Isamu Ryuuzaki of the Earth delegation is shot and killed.\r\n\r\nShortly after the disastrous end of the talks, the Barmians (called \u201cValerians\u201d in Starbirds) begin a campaign of terror against Earth, lead by Leon\u2019s son, Admiral Richter, who deploys a variety of \u201cMecha Soldiers\u201d against the planet\u2019s defenses. The only thing standing between the Earthlings and annihilation is the transforming, karate-using super robot, Daimos and its pilot, Kazuya Ryuuzaki. But that changes when he meets and falls in love with a mysterious girl named Erika, who turns out to be Richter's sister. Over the course of their struggles to reunite, Kazuya and Erika each learn that the other\u2019s people are not all evil...and that their own people are not all good.",
