  "synopsis": "It has been a century since \"true magic\"\u2014initially thought to be merely folklore and legend\u2014had become commonplace technology worldwide. First National Magic University Affiliated High School (First High), one of the nine magic academies in Japan, admits two skilled siblings\u2014Miyuki and Tatsuya Shiba\u2014into the academy. First High splits its students into two groups, Course 1 and Course 2, based on entrance exam scores. This causes an apparent disdain for the Course 2 students, as they are labeled \"Weeds\" by Course 1 students, who alternatively call themselves \"Blooms.\"\r\n\r\nTatsuya is admitted to Course 2, while his sister Miyuki joins Course 1 as an honor student. Miyuki wishes to show First High that, despite her brother being labeled as inept, he is among the best magicians in the whole world.\r\n\r\nMahouka Koukou no Yuutousei retells the story of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei from the point of view of Miyuki and the other female characters.",
