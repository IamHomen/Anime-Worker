After falling victim to a robbery by a woman and losing all his money, Tatsumi is taken in by a noble aristocratic girl by the name of\u00a0Aria. In the following night, Aria's place is attacked by a group of assassins known as\u00a0Night Raid. While Tatsumi at first tries to defend Aria from the assassin\u00a0Akame, another member of the group stops the fight. She reveals that Aria has kidnapped several villagers and tortures them for fun. Shocked upon seeing the tortured villagers \u2014 including his two best friends, Tatsumi kills Aria.\nSeeing potential in Tatsumi, Night Raid invites the boy to their group warning that regardless of how they want to assassin corrupted people, they are murderers.

In their fight against the Empire, Night Raid starts antagonizing an organization known as\u00a0The Jaegars\u00a0led by\u00a0Esdeath, the most powerful fighter in the Empire. As both Night Raid and Jaegars suffer losses, the Empire forms a new secret police force, the\u00a0Wild Hunt, with the son of the Prime Minister,\u00a0Shura, as its leader, to bolster its law reinforcements, though Wild Hunt heavily abuses its new authority by killing innocent civilians for fun.",
