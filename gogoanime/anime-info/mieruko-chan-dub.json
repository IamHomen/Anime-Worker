But ever since one fateful day, she is the only person aware of the invisible monsters walking freely among humans.\r\n\r\nCourageously, Miko makes a bold decision: she will never, under any condition, acknowledge the presence of the horrid specters. However, even though she pretends they do not exist, she can still see how they disturb the people around her, especially her best friend, the energetic and lovely Hana Yurikawa. In order to protect them from the monsters' annoyances, Miko gives it her best to continue her school life and avoid every troublesome crisis\u2014even when they scare her to tears.",
