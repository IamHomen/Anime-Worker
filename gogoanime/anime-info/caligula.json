Only humans who are suffering in the real world and strongly relate to \u03bc's songs are lured into Mobius. \r\n\r\nOnce they enter, people often forget that the real world exists. Regardless of age or gender, they are turned into students and forced to experience school life over and over, which \u03bc considers \"the most radiant time in a person's life.\"",
