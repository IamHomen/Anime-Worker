However, Makoto differs significantly from the person Saki perceives: Makoto is not a girl, but rather a cross-dressing boy!\r\n\r\nAfter revealing his well-known secret to Saki, Makoto expects her to be disgusted. Surprisingly, she is instead captivated by this revelation. Nonetheless, he still rejects her, but Saki's determination does not stop her from declaring that she will become his first love. With Saki and his childhood friend at his side, Makoto's world brightens, giving him strength amid his struggle between his interests and the expectations placed on him.",
