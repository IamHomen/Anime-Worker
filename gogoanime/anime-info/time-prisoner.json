Three years ago, in a mission to receive the treasure, due to the gullibility of the captain Hao Yuan, the Phantom Squad was attacked by the Derek Squad, and almost all of them were killed in action. Hao Yuan himself was also planted by Derek and fell into the cliff. However, the target treasure \u2013 the eternal stone accidentally entered Hao Yuan\u2019s body, bringing him back from the dead and gaining the supernatural ability to manipulate time, possessing superpowers such as time standstill and time rewind.
