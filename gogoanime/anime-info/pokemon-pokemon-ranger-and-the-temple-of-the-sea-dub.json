According to legend, a temple the Water People built called \"The Water Temple Akuusha\" rests somewhere in the ocean, and a treasure called \"The Water Crown\" is hidden there. It's said that no one has ever seen this treasure, but that changes when a Pokemon Ranger named Jack Walker (aka Jackie) appears to chase aftert it.\r\n\r\nJackie is on a top secret mission that has him protecting the egg of the leader of the water pokemon, Manaphy.
