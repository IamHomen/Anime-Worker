  "synopsis": "The protagonist, Zhu Wen, is a player who is pulled into the real-life escape room game called \u201cParadise.\u201d Zhu Wen has an unique way of thinking, and instead of following the normal decryption process, he exploits game rule loopholes and bugs, relying on his exceptional physical abilities to bypass challenges without solving them. His urgency to complete the game is driven by the fact that he is searching for his missing sister, Zhen Zhu, and his stepsister, Jiang Lan, who are trapped within the game. Zhu Wen and his friends repeatedly use bug exploits to progress rapidly through the game, eventually reaching the \u201cEndgame\u201d phase. In this stage, all players are forcefully drawn into the game world, and everything that happens in the game has consequences in the real world. As they desperately search for clues to complete the game, they discover that their world is not the first one chosen by \u201cParadise.\u201d Countless other worlds and players have been affected by the game, and even the \u201cEndgame\u201d scenario is the home of the previous set of players. \u201cParadise\u201d has undergone multiple rounds of gameplay, becoming nearly unbeatable through repeated optimizations. It even leaves critical clues in locations in the real world that are almost impossible for anyone to access. Zhu Wen, however, figures out that the game\u2019s internal coordinates correspond to real-world coordinates and successfully calculates the location of the game\u2019s core. Cooperating with his friends and a real-world strategy team, they deplete the game\u2019s energy resources and manage to narrowly win the life-and-death battle with \u201cParadise.\u201d The game is then reset, and players are returned to the real world. Zhu Wen finally reunites with Zhen Zhu and Jiang Lan, and they can live a wonderful life free from the grip of the game that had threatened them.",
