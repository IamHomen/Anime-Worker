  "synopsis": "A story about the humorous misadventures of Akabane Aya, an arrogant high school girl who\u2019s constantly trying to outdo her classmates in everything (especially sex appeal), only to make a fool of herself in the process. Since the story takes place in an all-girls school, expect lots of yuri fanservice innuendos without much seriousness.",
