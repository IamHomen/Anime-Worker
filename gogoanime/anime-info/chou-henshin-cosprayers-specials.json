They mostly depict stories that take place in-between episodes from the main series.\r\n\r\nSpecial #1 takes place in-between episodes 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nSpecial #2 takes place in-between episodes 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nSpecial #3 doesn't fit very well in-between any of the main series, and is more of a side-story.",
