In addition to their mixed reactions, when the fianc\u00e9 arrives, the last thing the Tendou family expects is Ranma Saotome and his father, Genma.\r\n\r\nRanma has been training in China with his father until an unfortunate accident changed them both. Now, when water touches them, Ranma turns into a girl and Genma into a giant panda.
