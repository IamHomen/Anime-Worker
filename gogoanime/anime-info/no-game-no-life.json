  "synopsis": "The story of No Game, No Life centers around Sora and Shiro, a brother and sister whose reputations as brilliant NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) hikikomori (shut-in) gamers have spawned urban legends all over the Internet. These two gamers even consider the real world as just another \"crappy game.\" One day, they are summoned by a boy named \"God\" to an alternate world. There, God has prohibited war and declared this to be a world where \"everything is decided by games\" - even national borders. Humanity has been driven back into one remaining city by the other races. Will Sora and Shiro, the good-for-nothing brother and sister, become the \"Saviors of Humanity\" on this alternate world? \"Well, let's start playing.\"",
