With the memories of his father's mysterious death and an encounter of a mysterious boy and girl, Daiji arrives on the island while the alarm of a building labeled \"Earth Engine\" is going off. Someone asks him \"Are you a captain?\" just as robotic intruders from Uranus called \"Kiltgang\" arrive. The battle around the shining stars is about to begin.",
