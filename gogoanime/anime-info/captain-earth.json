One night right before summer vacation, Daichi Manatsu, a second-year in high school, sees a weird round rainbow floating in the sky above Seed Island (Shuushi/Tane Island) and ventures there alone. He has seen this rainbow before. With the memories of his father's mysterious death and an encounter of a mysterious boy and girl, Daiji arrives on the island while the alarm of a building labeled \"Earth Engine\" is going off. Someone asks him \"Are you a captain?\" just as robotic intruders from Uranus called \"Kiltgang\" arrive. The battle around the shining stars is about to begin.",
