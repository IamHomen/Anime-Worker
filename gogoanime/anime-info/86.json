  "synopsis": "The Republic of San Magnolia.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, this country has been besieged by its neighbor, the Giadian Empire, which created a series of unmanned drones called the Legion. After years of painstaking research, the Republic finally developed autonomous drones of their own, turning the one-sided struggle into a war without casualties\u2014or at least, that's what the government claims.\r\n\r\nIn truth, there is no such thing as a bloodless war. Beyond the fortified walls protecting the eighty-five Republic territories lies the \"nonexistent\" Eighty-Sixth Sector. The young men and women of this forsaken land are branded the Eighty-Six and, stripped of their humanity, pilot the \"unmanned\" weapons into battle...\r\n\r\nShinn directs the actions of a detachment of young Eighty-Sixers while on the battlefield. Lena is a \"handler\" who commands the detachment from the remote rear with the help of special communication.\r\n\r\nThe farewell story of the severe and sad struggle of these two begins!",
