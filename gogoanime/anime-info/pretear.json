  "synopsis": "Shin Shirayuki Hime Densetsu Pretear\u00a0is a long title which translates into \"New Legend of Snow White Pretear\". What makes Pretear special is the story. It's a magical girl show, but it's part Cinderella plus part Snow White and a dash of bishounen! You will see a lot of fairy tale parallels with this anime series.\nOn her way to school,\u00a0Himeno\u00a0meets a little boy who asks her to take his hand. When she does, she faints and later wakes up staring up at a dark haired bishounen!The bishounen who helps revive her turns out to be\u00a0Hayate, one of the seven knights of the Earth. They were looking for Shin Shirayuki Hime Densetsu Pretear (the legendary magical girl that can help them save the Earth from ruin and destruction). Hayate, the more temperamental of the seven believes that Himeno is the girl they are looking for.The story is not just about Himeno and the seven knights. It is also about her home life and her father,\u00a0Kaoru. Kaoru and Himeno are very close to each other.\u00a0Natsue, Kaoru's new wife, is jealous of the closeness that Himeno and Kaoru share. Natsue also has two spoilt daughters,\u00a0Mawate\u00a0and\u00a0Mayune. Her father, Kaoru, is so enamoured with his new wife, and the life he is living, that he assumes Himeno is happy too.",
