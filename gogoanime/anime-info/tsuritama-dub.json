  "synopsis": "You can't catch fish if you don't go fishing, and you can't make friends if you don't at least try.\r\n\r\nWhich is how relationship-challenged student Yuki finds himself on a fishing trip to a tiny island with three other boys he barely knows. Well, two other boys and Haru, who claims that he's an alien. Not that constantly stewing Natsuki or mysterious Akira are any more likely as prospects for good companionship.\r\n\r\nBut there's something about fishing that makes it unlike any other pastime, and maybe that quiet sense of companionship and hopeful expectation is just what Yuki needs to start charting the unfamiliar waters of personal connections. Or maybe it will turn out that Haru's right and they're going to have to save the entire planet.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of different kinds of fish stories, from the \"ones that got away\" to the \"best catches ever,\" but whichever way the currents of life take them, for four young men, this trip may turn out to be the biggest whopper ever!",
