In the seemingly peaceful country of Nafrece, Margaret Burton lives a tranquil life.\nAs separate as their lives may seem, the two are connected by ties of mystery, and by a holy book that is also sought by the shadowy organisation, Anfan. As Margaret and Madlax follow the path of their destiny, they come ever closer to uncovering the truth \u2013 with no guarantee that it is a truth they can bear to learn.",
