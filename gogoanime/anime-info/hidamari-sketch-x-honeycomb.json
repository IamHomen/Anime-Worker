  "synopsis": "Studying at the Yamabuki Arts High School has been a dream-come-true for Yuno, and she\u2019s learned so much already! And not just from her instructors, but from her friends and neighbors who\u2019ve become her second family and made the Hidemari Apartments such a safe and nurturing home. But as the day of her \u201cbig sisters\u201d Sae and Hiro\u2019s graduation draws slowly closer, it\u2019s time for Yuno to start seriously taking on the same role for Nazuna, Nori and the other budding young artists who\u2019ve entered Hidemari\u2019s protective cocoon.\nAnd it\u2019s also time to tackle some really challenging artistic assignments. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t still be time for fun with Miyako and all the others, but it\u2019s definitely time to pencil in her plans for the future. And sometimes that means you have to put the art before the course!",
