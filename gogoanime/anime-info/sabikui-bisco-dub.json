The cause of the catastrophic state of the world is believed to be mushroom spores. Bisco Akaboshi, known as the \"Man-Eating Mushroom,\" is a wanted criminal archer whose arrows instantly grow mushrooms wherever they land. However, he is in truth a \"Mushroom Protector,\" a person who spreads fungi in order to enrich the land and return it to its previous state.\r\n\r\nAlongside the crab Akutagawa and young doctor Milo Nekoyanagi, Bisco ventures through the wastelands of Japan searching for the legendary \"Sabikui\"\u2014a panacean mushroom said to devour all forms of rust.",
