But something is causing the Autoraves to become independent and is driving them to seek to escape the city.\u00a0\nRe-l Mayer, a female inspector from the\u00a0Citizen Information Board, learns that the awakening of the Autoraves is caused by an encounter with something called a\u00a0Proxy. In seeking to learn more, Re-l stumbles into a secret that management is desperately trying to hide and will go to any length to keep suppressed.",
