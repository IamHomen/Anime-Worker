In order to protect their beloved ones, the group must hold their own against the seemingly insurmountable enemy force\u2014even if some of those foes were once their allies, or perhaps, something more intimate.\r\n\r\nAs the final act of this chaotic war commences, the ideals Shirou believes will soon be challenged by an excruciating dilemma: is it really possible to save a world where everything seems to have gone wrong?",
